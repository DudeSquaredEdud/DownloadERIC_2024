        "title":"Software for Teaching about AIDS & Sex: A Critical Review of Products. A MicroSIFT Report.",
        "author":["Weaver, Dave"],
        "description":"This document contains critical reviews of 10 microcomputer software packages and two interactive videodisc products designed for use in teaching about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and sex at the secondary school level and above. Each package was reviewed by one or two secondary school health teachers and by a staff member from the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory's Technology Program using the MicroSIFT Courseware Evaluation form. The 12 packages reviewed are: (1) AIDS Information Delivery System; (2) AIDS--An Educational Program; (3) AIDS: Informational Defense System; (4) AIDS: The Investigation; (5) AIDS: The New Epidemic; (6) Body Awareness Resource Network: AIDS; (7) Body Awareness Resource Network: Human Sexuality; (8) Practicing Sexual Decision  Making; (9) Romance: Game of Choice About Sex; (10) STD: Sexually Transmitted Disease Information; (11) Understanding AIDS; and (12) Venereal Disease. A section on findings calls the overall results somewhat disappointing, noting that most packages were tutorials followed by drill questions perceived as dull and uninspiring to students. The teachers' views on AIDS as a serious topic is given as one reason for the criticism received by packages using a game format. It is reported that teachers were generally satisfied with the content, finding a broad range of depth and maturity levels in the materials available. For each product, information is provided on the producer, hardware needed, price, audience, type of program, copyright date, a brief description, possible uses, strengths,  weaknesses, and relevant comments. Producer contact information is given; the courseware evaluation form is appended. (NB)",

        "description":"Caregiving studies often focus on the impaired elder who is the care receiver and the one family member who is perceived as the primary caregiver. Such studies fail to consider all members of the family, whether or not they are involved in providing care. This study was conducted to explore the effects of an elder's health-related dependency on the family network through the eyes of family members other than and including the primary caregiver and care receiver. It focused on the nature of the caregiving experience and the types of changes that family members experience in response to a health-related dependency. Subjects were participants in the University of Southern California's Longitudinal Study of Generations and included 20 families interviewed in 1973, 1985, and 1986.  Semi-structured interviews concerned with the health decline of the older family member and the effects on other family members were completed by an average of three to four members per family. The results suggest that: (1) caregiving is often a shared responsibility between either multiple primary caregivers, very involved secondary caregivers, or both; (2) a substantial part of the family network is affected by the experience of caregiving for an older adult; (3) the effects on family relationships are often positive as well as negative; and (4) network effects include altered perspectives about aging, one's own mortality, and other family members.

        "description":"This monograph describes a project developed at Children's Hospital of Boston as an innovative, exemplary program of training, research, and services for the treatment of family violence in a pediatric hospital, with a particular focus on child abuse and neglect. Chapter 1 explains why it is important to study the area of family violence, presenting the view that violence is a family problem and describing several forms of child abuse, including physical abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. Chapter 2 discusses conceptual and procedural challenges facing family violence service programs. Chapter 3 provides an overview of what is known about family violence, looking at the incidence and causes of family violence, research on pediatric social illness and sexual victimization, issues of  defining and labeling, effects of maltreatment and sexual abuse on children, spouse abuse, effective interventions, limitations to research evidence, and service needs. Chapter 4 presents the Children's Hospital Program on Family Violence, describing the Trauma X team, the Family Development Study, the Family Advocacy Program, the Family Development Clinic, the development of a clinical training program, and inservice training. Chapter 5 looks at the model hospital-based training program on family violence, discussing the family violence seminar, the journal group, fellowship program, how to bridge research and practice, and issues in clinical training. Chapter 6 examines professional roles in the service and training program in family violence, and chapter 7 provides conclusions and  recommendations. References are included. (NB)",

        "description":"Hardiness has been defined as a mediator in life stress and, within the health/illness context, has been conceptualized as a personality characteristic. This study used a descriptive exploratory design to examine the concept of hardiness among elderly women. The Stress, Appraisal, and Coping model developed by Lazarus and Folkman (1986) was the organizing framework for the study. The Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale was administered to 24 women between the ages of 67 and 91, and in-depth guided interviews that explored a stressful event and individual responses to the event were conducted with all subjects. Demographic information was also obtained. The findings suggest that most subjects were able to adapt successfully, to continue to have a life purpose, and to  restore balance to their lives following a major loss. Five dimensions of hardiness were identified: equanimity, self-efficacy, perseverance, meaningfulness, and existential aloneness. The hardy individual may be able to mobilize coping resources more successfully and use appropriate emotion- and problem-focused coping responses. Subjects were able to cope with stressful events as evidenced by their successful adaptations and high levels of morale. Hardiness may contribute to an understanding of appraisal, coping responses, and adaptation. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"There is growing evidence that the stress of caring for a relative with Alzheimer's disease may have adverse effects on the caregivers. This study was conducted to explore the mental health consequences of caregiving. Psychological data and mental health status information were obtained from 50 Alzheimer's disease spousal caregivers and from 50 category matched (age, sex, and socioeconomic status) comparison subjects. The results revealed that caregivers had significantly higher rates of depressive disorder while caregiving than the comparison subjects during the same period. Additionally, caregivers had significantly higher current dysphoria as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p&gt;.001). The data suggest that certain chronic stressors may be linked to the onset of  depressive disorder. As the population continues to age and the number of Alzheimer's disease patients increases, family caregivers may become an increasingly important risk group. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"While a number of factors influencing the adjustment of family members following divorce have been studied, the relationship of the child's gender to the custodial mother's adjustment has not received much systematic attention. This study examined the relationship between gender of the eldest child and self-reported psychopathology of the custodial mother in a sample of 90 divorced or separated families. Groups included 38 families referred for outpatient treatment of a child between the ages of 6 and 10 and a comparison group of 52 well-functioning families screened for the absence of child psychopathology. The results indicated that, compared to the mothers in the well-functioning families, mothers of clinic children evidenced significantly greater global psychological distress  and symptomatology as well as greater depression and anxiety. Contrary to expectation, mothers of boys had no more adjustment difficulties as a whole than did mothers of girls. However, mothers of clinic-referred girls evidenced greater severity of symptoms than did mothers of clinic-referred boys and mothers of nonclinic children. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Past research has shown that teenagers with less educated parents and teenagers with lower academic aspirations are more likely than their peers to smoke. This study was conducted to provide additional descriptive data concerning the relationships of smoking to parents' education and students' educational aspirations and to provide preliminary evidence concerning causes of the inverse relationships between smoking and the education variables. Data were obtained for white high school seniors from the 1985 Monitoring the Future survey of high school seniors. The results revealed that students who had less educated parents or lower educational aspirations of their own were more likely to have tried a cigarette, more likely to have adopted cigarette smoking, and less likely to have  quit smoking. These students also had more favorable attitudes toward smoking and reported greater acceptance of smoking by their friends. In addition, students with less educated parents or lower educational aspirations appeared to be more rejecting of adult authority and more predisposed to adopt adult behaviors, and these characteristics in turn were associated with smoking more. Multivariate analyses of these data, together with evidence from other studies, support the hypothesis that favorable attitudes toward smoking, social acceptance of smoking, and a tendency to adopt adult behaviors contribute to the higher rates of smoking among students with less educated parents or lower educational aspirations.

        "description":"While research has identified several factors related to female domestic violence victims, the cross-sectional methodologies used make it difficult to determine whether these factors predispose the individual to victimization. This study used a longitudinal design to assess the predictive power of indices of economic, social, and psychological resources found to be related to victimization among women by previous studies. Individuals engaged to be married for the first time were recruited through newpaper and radio advertisements. Volunteer couples were assessed approximately 1 month before their wedding dates and again 6 months and 18 months after their weddings. Data were obtained from 315 wives at each of the three assessment periods. Eighteen months after their weddings, 80  wives reported being the victims of at least one incident of their husband's physical aggression during the past year. The results support the utility of certain premarital and early marital economic and psychological resources as significant predictors of victimization status and variance in extent of victimization among victimized wives. Women with lower incomes and who were less secure with their jobs and with their economic situations generally were more likely to be victims of their husbands' violence and to experience more frequent and severe domestic violence. Women who were less aggressive, especially in the marriage, and who reported greater negative stress were more likely to be victims and to experience greater severity and frequency of domestic violence. Social support  resources did not prove to be significant predictors of victimization. (NB)",

        "description":"Many women today expect themselves to be everything to everybody, simultaneously meeting the expectations of the workplace and the family. This multifaceted lifestyle usually entails trying to meet incompatible demands with the unavoidable outcome of stress. Learning better ways of managing this stress is imperative for both health and happiness. Developing the trait of hardiness and working to replace cynicism with a more constructive, optimistic, and vital outlook seem to be central to more effective coping with stress. Individuals who demonstrate high levels of four personality characteristics (commitment, control, confidence, cooperation) have been found to withstand unusually high levels of life stress without becoming physically or psychologically compromised. Building a  sense of commitment involves seeing the world as interesting and benign. It also requires clarifying one's values and resolving ambivalence about lifestyle choices. Enhancing a sense of control requires recognizing how personal choices dictate outcomes. Increasing confidence involves recognizing one's potential for coping and becoming more future- and change-oriented. Seeing change and new demands as potential adventure requires an ability to tolerate risk and failure. Increasing the level of cooperation within a family requires a climate of trust and caring. These suggested activities have worked for many women. (ABL)",

Mobility studies which have been undertaken indicate that correlations, although not necessarily cause-and-effect relationships, between mobility and poor achievement in language, reading, and mathematics have been found. For successful adaptation to a new school it has been claimed that the child must find an acceptable place among new peers, be able to meet the academic and behavior standards,  and be accepted by the teacher. Effective school research has indicated that small focused programs with staff commitment can assist at-risk students. It has been recommended that there be individualized attention for leaving and newly entering students, and that parent handbooks and institutionalized practices be designed to assist children in making adjustments. School counselors can arrange opportunities for students to discuss adjustment problems. Teachers can be prepared to teach children who are culturally different. Services for immigrating groups and the mobile handicapped can be provided. (ABL)",

        "description":"Ten years of research on developmental models of supervision in counseling generally support the premises of the models. Nevertheless, very little is known about the conduct of effective supervision. Future research needs to explore the relationship between supervision, trainee outcomes, and trainee type. Supervision should adopt a pragmatic agenda, more directly investigating the relevance of developmental models to the actual practice of supervision. These studies would have the potential for guiding daily interactions with supervisees. Researchers should implement \"moratoriums\" on three types of research: (1) model-building; (2) self-reports of satisfaction and self-reports of perception of supervision events; and (3) academic settings. Researchers should directly measure  actual supervision events, conduct collaborative studies with field supervisors, and work toward a \"technology\" of developmental supervision interventions. A pragmatic focus does not imply that theoretical questions are unimportant. However, after 10 years of theoretical discussion and empirical reports, little has been contributed to day-to-day supervision activity. Investigations of what actually happens during supervision and of what works with particular supervisors and supervisees can give relevance to developmental models of supervision and enhance the practice of supervision.

        "description":"American family life is being transformed by both parents increasingly becoming employed. This change has created a need for strategies to assist single-parent and two-paycheck families. Two-paycheck families present problems to clinical psychologists. External demands on these families include the demands of the workplace, children's needs, the needs of aging parents, and household responsibilities. Internal difficulties include guilt, anxiety, alienation, powerlessness, rigidity, anger, and competition. Four factors characterize successful two-paycheck couples: commitment, control, confidence, and cooperation. Commitment involves believing in the choices that you make about how to live your life, and seeing your life as meaningful. Building a sense of commitment involves seing  the world as interesting and benign. Control involves experiencing yourself as ultimately responsible for the shape of your life. Enhancing a sense of control requires recognizing how personal choices dictate outcomes. Confidence is the ability to see changes as developmental opportunities, rather than as a threat to security. Increasing confidence involves recognizing one's potential for coping and becoming more future and change oriented. Cooperation involves a mutual approach to solving problems, grounded in an awareness of and respect for others' needs. Increasing the level of cooperation within a family requires a climate of trust and caring. Two-paycheck families are not perfect, but their choices can facilitate the growth and development of all family members in a manner which more  closely approximates fairness to all. (ABL)",

Students were identified in the eighth grade and given the opportunity to enroll in a special alternative program. Students not in the alternative program but who seemed to have school adjustment problems were identified by teachers and placed in an \"Adopt-a-Student\" program with teachers providing a role model, showing there was someone who cared, helping the students set realistic goals, and enhancing the student's self-esteem. A peer counseling program/youth motivator program is  currently being started in which high school students work with middle and elementary school students. A video tape using alumni, military recruiters, and turn-around students to entice students to stay in school is being developed. A data bank of alumni names, addresses, and places of employment is used as a volunteer recruitment tool. Alumni and parents served as youth motivators and tutors. Volunteer hours and numbers increased as the program became established. A newsletter, extra assemblies, facelift, a videotape for civic organizations, and pep club were used to improve the community's image of the school. A magnet school study was undertaken.

        "description":"As the American population continues to age, more and more adult children and their elderly parents are examining their beliefs about what constitutes appropriate filial behavior. This study was conducted to investigate filial responsibility expectations endorsed by a randomly selected sample of 144 elder parent-adult child pairs from the Harrisburg area of Pennsylvania. Descriptive statistics suggest that most older parents and adult children interpreted the filial role to include a great deal of emotional support and discussion of important matters and available resources. Both generations perceived living close and writing letters to parents on a weekly basis as less important. Parents were more likely to disapprove of receiving financial assistance from children, living with  children, and having children adjust their work schedules to help them than were their offspring. Robinson's statistical measure of agreement, which examined the amount of consensus between generations, revealed that there was a moderate level of agreement between parents and their children on filial responsibility expectations. Multiple regression analyses indicated that amount of agreement on filial norms did not have an impact on parental well-being. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"This document describes and illustrates an approach to expressive writing which employs student-authored books--\"I Am The Author Books\" (ITABs)--for use in individual and group counseling with children. It begins with a brief review of pertinent literature on expressive writing as a counseling intervention, and then describes experiences with ITABs. A case example describing the writing of a book on death and loss by a fourth-grade girl whose young sister died in a home accident is used to illustrate the technique. Following this example, other possible uses for ITABs are discussed and examples of other types of problems children can write about are given. The need to alter the format and process depending on the client's age, counseling needs, learning style, and perception of  self is acknowledged. The tendency for young children to be highly receptive to this counseling technique is described and it is suggested that authoring a book helps these children to feel important, provides a medium with which they are familiar and comfortable, gives them the feeling that they are helping others, allows them to nurture \"native imagery\" through creative energy, and leads to self-discovery through self-expression. The resistance to ITABs by older children and young adolescents is discussed and strategies counselors can use to assauge this resistance are listed. The use of ITABs in group sessions or with an entire class is discussed. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper examines the moral presuppositions of public policy and professional practice concerned with the sexual victimization of children by adults. It begins with an overview of the problem of child sexual abuse and a set of 10 generalizations drawn from research on both clinical and non-clinical samples of victims. Three responsibilities which need to be undertaken by researchers and clinicians are proposed: (1) that they develop a better understanding of the moral-ideological background of current interest in the problem of child sexual abuse; (2) that they acknowledge those facts which might conflict with their own moral presuppositions and challenge those beliefs which impede a proper understanding of the victim; and (3) that they put the victim's needs and perceptions at  the head of their treatment priorities, thereby challenging themselves to be more critical of their professional response to reports of child sexual abuse. Research is reviewed in the areas of moral-ideological background, the question of harm, treatment issues, and implications for moral theory. The report concludes that professionals who work with victims of child sexual abuse must respect the personhood of the child as a moral absolute, must always work to minimize the harm which a child suffers from abuse, and must ensure that the child's opinions and perceptions of victimization are respected.

        "description":"Counselors often deal with the meaning of work and love as they help clients to manage or modify their lives. This is especially true for counselors involved in career interventions such as career education programs, vocational guidance and counseling, work adjustment counseling, occupational health counseling, and retirement planning workshops. All of these interventions address the meaning of work and love, although they vary in emphasis. Explicit attention to the meaning of work and love can benefit almost every person in individual career counseling, group vocational guidance, or career development workshops and classes. Counselors should consider their client's views of work and love, helping clients to self-explore the meaning of work and love and how this meaning relates  to the developmental challenges or personal problems which the client brings to counseling. This paper presents a rationale for asking people to examine what work and love mean to them. It describes various methods for eliciting the personal meaning of work and love, teaching the social meaning of work and love, and creating new meaning. To illustrate the approach used in creating new meaning, nine sample cases are briefly presented. A table illustrating Robert Sternberg's contrasts between work and love, and a list of recommended readings are included. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper asserts that the most common mistake that adults make when relating to children who are grieving is to assume that children think like adults. It presents an outline of children's perceptions of death for children between the ages of 1 and 3, and for 4-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and 10-year-olds. The outline and examples of children's perceptions of death at various ages are used to illustrate that children have a different approach to grieving than do adults. Several approaches are discussed which can help adults reach the child's perception of death and talk about death in a meaningful way. These include reaching preschool children in their perceptions through play therapy; anecdotal records including structuring, nurturing,  challenging, and intruding functions; the Sentence Completion Test; and the Thematic Photograph Book; and for adolescents a model One Session Grief Counseling Group. The paper concludes with the hope that reaching the child's perception of death will lead to other creative strategies for assisting children who must deal with death. (NB)",

        "description":"Research on residential relocation has reported mixed findings on the impact of such relocation on psychological well-being. Theorists have postulated that one's perception of an event will influence one's response to it and that response will influence the outcome. This study examined older persons' reactions to a residential relocation based on this cognitive phenomenological theory. Subjects were 75 white, upper middle class persons who were 75 years of age or older and who had recently moved from one level of independence to another within a church-related retirement center. Subjects completed the revised Ways of Coping Checklist, the Life Satisfaction Index-Z, and investigator-designed questions to obtain data on conditioning variables and perceptions of the relocation. The  results revealed that 80% of respondents perceived their relocation as a somewhat or very significant event in their lives. Most believed they had somewhat to very much control over whether to make the move and over what was happening in their lives at the time of the interview. Most of the conditioning variables examined seemed to have little influence on perceptions, coping strategies, and life satisfaction; however, the degree of independence associated with the new residence and distance from family members did show evidence of influencing some perceptions and some coping strategies. Perceptions of the relocation seemed to relate only to the specific coping strategies of wishful thinking and avoidance. Other findings suggest that, although perceptions did not relate to most of the  coping strategies, they may have a direct relationship to life satisfaction. (NB)",

        "author":["Horacek, Bruce J."],
        "description":"Classical models of the grieving process include Freud's concept of withdrawal of ties to the love object called decathexis, and Lindemann's emancipation from the bondage to the deceased involving adjusting to the loss in one's environment and the ability to form new relationships. Most of the models and explanations of the grieving process over the past 20 years are derived from the work of Freud and Lindemann. Recent research has challenged previous work, finding that grief from major losses may never completely end, but that the bereaved learn to live with an \"empty space\" in their lives. These new conclusions affect the grieving process of older persons. Grief reactions such as confusion, depression, and preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased might be mistaken for other  conditions that affect the elderly such as dementias or other forms of depression and deterioration. The elderly are more prone to bereavement overload or multiple losses which could push an older person over the line of unbearability. These social expectations can aggravate older persons' grief: (1) elderly people should show a \"stiff upper lip\" about their losses since they should expect losses; (2) society seems uncomfortable with strong outward displays of mourning; and (3) the mourning process is becoming \"deritualized\" with rituals becoming briefer, simpler, and more private--a trend that could reduce the solace and support that the elderly receive from such rituals.

        "author":["Forster, Jerald R."],
        "description":"The Dependable Strengths Articulation Process (DSAP) is a systematic intervention which enables individuals to recognize, articulate, communicate, and use their Dependable Strengths. Dependable Strengths are those personal strengths that are clearly established and owned by the individual. They can earn the Dependable Strengths designation by satisfying these criteria: (1) they have been used in at least three different Good Experiences; (2) they can usually be traced back to childhood; and (3) the owner wants to use them in future activities. Good Experiences occur when one feels one has done something well, enjoyed doing it, and takes some pride in it. The DSAP model can be used to focus on the effects of the weight given the person's meaningful constructs. If the weighting  factor is stressed, then methods designed to change self-esteem would seek to increase the weighting of those constructs known to be related to the person's Dependable Strengths. The intended outcomes of the DSAP include a revised self-identity and increased self-esteem. Assumptions underlying the DSAP include the following: individuals and modern society are complex; a person's self-identity depends upon the particular qualities attended to by the person when the individual is aware of the self; and if the person rates highly on valued qualities the person will have high self-esteem and continue to seek growth and mastery.

        "description":"Academic achievement is increasing in schools, but so is the dropout rate. Excellence in schools must be defined more broadly than the scores students earn on achievement tests. Concerns such as equity must be a part of the definition of excellence in education. It is essential that for some programs with disproportionate enrollments, educators must actively work to reduce and eliminate, whenever possible, the barriers that prevent students from entering programs. These barriers exist in the form of discrimination, bias, and stereotyping. It is clear that disproportionate dropout rates occur for minority, handicapped, disadvantaged, and nontraditional students. It is just as clear that the dropout problem is closely associated with student self-image. The concern for excellence  in education tends to focus upon student achievement scores, yet the concern of equity is to ensure excellence for all students, regardless of their test scores. The excellence movement cannot achieve its intended purpose unless it responds appropriately to these needs. Ten strategies to achieve educational excellence include: (1) make student feel important; (2) make students feel invited; (3) deal with needed changes in others from a positive point of view; (4) learn to make appropriate nonverbal cues; (5) get to know each student personally; (6) learn to empathize; (7) establish parameters; (8) use student-centered instruction; (9) learn to know and understand the difference between discipline and punishment; and (10) be enthusiastic about teaching.

        "description":"A conceptual framework for studying the role of social support in explaining family caregivers' psychological well-being is developed in this paper. In particular, the framework presented emphasizes the importance of conceptualizing caregiving as a social status, and drawing upon the broader literature on status acquisitions, social support, and psychological well-being. This literatuare can be used to suggest that social support is likely to be most effective in reducing caregiver stress when it is provided by individuals with whom the caregiver shares a greater number of social statuses such as age, occupational prestige, and religion. Explanations are presented for the more positive effect of support from status-similar network members, and proposes longitudinal designs for  investigating this issue are proposed. It is concluded: that the most obvious implication of reconceptualizing caregiving as a social status is the need to develop methodologies that permit an explanation of changes in the structure and function of individuals' social networks across the caregiving career; (2) that the study of family caregivers provides an important and unique context in which to study the buffering effects of social support; and (3) that the research that investigates the structure of social networks across the early stages of the caregiving career will have a number of important implications for practitioners.

Nutritional components of weight loss programs should provide information which will enable participants to select and consume a nutritionally sound low-calorie diet. The goal of the nutrition component is to promote healthy weight loss through sound nutrition principles, adoption of an individualized exercise program, and a personal exchange diet plan. Behavior modification is an important part of weight loss programs. Modification of eating behaviors consists of techniques that encourage the development of a controlled eating style.  Stimulus control involves the modification of environmental cues so that undesirable responses will decrease in frequency and desireable responses will be more likely to occur. Contingency management refers to procedures designed to change the consequences for weight-related events in order to modifiy the probability of future occurrences. In this program college students meet with a registered dietitian individually and then attend a 6-week program. The program stresses appropriate food choices, the benefits of exercise, behavioral chains, cue elimination techniques, current issues in food, and interpreting food labels. Students have reported satisfaction with the class. Dietitians and psychologists need to work together to provide comprehensive weight managment programs.  (ABL)",

Results show that by the time they reach college, students have gained an implicit knowledge of word schemas reflecting subtle regularities of English vocabulary, which they can use when  evaluating possible meanings for new words.

Subjects, 24 kindergarteners and 34 second graders in a midwestern town, listened to 4 texts describing relatively unfamiliar topics with or without explanatory analogies. The children were asked to recall the information described in the texts and to communicate this information to another child. They were also asked several inferential questions about the topics. Results indicated that children in the analogy condition recalled and communicated more of the information contained in the texts and were more likely to remember the content units shared by the analogous concepts than the children in the no analogy  condition. This effect was stronger for the older children than for the younger children. Although the children made a number of erroneous inferences about the topic, these inferences were not related to the presence of the analogies. Results indicated that analogies can help children acquire information from expository text, presumably because they make it possible for the children to transfer an explanatory structure from a familiar domain to an unfamiliar one.

J. Guszak. In the 1967 study, Guszak recorded and analyzed reading group story discussions for students and teachers in grades 2, 4, and 6, revealing an overall emphasis at all grades on literal level questions, with a few more evaluation level questions than either conjecture or explanation questions. Fifteen teachers and their classrooms participated in the current study. All class discussions were videotaped and transcribed for analysis. Using similar analysis schemes, this study reported a sharp reduction in literal level questions, with a large increase in the explanation  category, but with the percentage of evaluation and conjecture questions comparable to the original study. While significant changes were found in the type of questions governing discussions, almost no change was found in the patterns of interactions, such as the frequent repetition of IREs (teacher initiates an interaction, student responds, and teacher evaluates). Observations indicate that teachers still dominate discussions and control interactions, but rely more on questions that invoke students' knowledge and less on text-based questions.

Among the obstacles to teacher change are short-term inservice attempts, teacher isolation, norm of the status quo, learning needs of teachers, and an expectation of fidelity to the plan for desired change. These obstacles can be overcome by recognizing that change is a process, not an event, and requires time and ongoing support. Three case studies demonstrate staff development efforts to implement research-based reading and writing instruction. The case studies (all in a K-12 school district with  over 20,000 students, 1,000 teachers, and 30 schools and only one reading and one language arts coordinator) include a process writing program at the elementary level, a revision of the remedial program in reading and writing at the junior high level, and a staff development inservice program for elementary school reading specialists designed to implement sound research-based reading instruction.

Subjects were 36 fourth grade and 36 seventh grade poor comprehenders (all were English-speaking Canadians) who participated in 13 sessions of reading strategy instruction or reading practice (control condition). Students were instructed to make predictions when reading, to generate questions about text, to summarize what was read, and to clarify points that were hard to understand. The strategies were first taught using the reciprocal instruction  approach developed by A. S. Palincsar and A. L. Brown, which involves providing support to students as they need it and peer teaching of strategies. Control subjects were exposed to the same materials as reciprocally trained students, but were given no strategy instructions. The most important finding was that a greater increase from before to after training on standardized reading comprehension occurred in the subjects who were reciprocally trained than in the control groups. This effect is important, given that standardized comprehension measures tap important reading skills and are used extensively in making curriculum and instruction decisions. Additional research in reciprocal instruction would be useful. (Five tables of data and one figure are included, and 43 references are  attached.) (RAE)",

The aim of the study was to learn how practices observed in earlier classroom research could be improved. The more specific goal was to identify factors that facilitate or impede change. Subjects were a kindergarten teacher in Illinois and her morning and afternoon kindergarten classes. Even though the teacher was selected because of her expressed interest in replacing customary practices with something better, the reform efforts were more difficult and less successful than had been anticipated. The children's achievement, as measured by tests, was most satisfactory; the teacher's way of working, however, continued to be less than satisfactory in some  important ways. Results suggested that school personnel interested in reform efforts should keep in mind that it is important to know (1) how teachers define success; (2) how teachers perceive the function of the reformer; (3) that teachers identify differences among students as a first step in effecting change; (4) that classroom management should be given early and persistent attention; and (5) that some children must be kept profitably occupied while the teacher instructs others. Findings also suggest the need to include first-grade teachers in reform efforts in order to facilitate communication and coordination among teachers who are now charged with responsibility for bringing beginning literacy into existence.

        "description":"As part of a longitudinal study of the acquisition of reading skills, a study tested kindergarten children at the beginning and end of their kindergarten year. The children were also observed for nine full days in their classrooms. Subjects were approximately 650 children in two cohorts. Data were collected in three school districts in Illinois, of which two had half-day kindergarten programs and one a full-day program. Descriptive findings and results from multiple regression analyses reveal strong relationships between the children's Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) scores upon entering kindergarten and their spring scores on three measures of reading performance, the WRAT, the Chicago, and the Woodcock Reading Comprehension paragraphs. There were also substantial and  significant differences among districts on these end-of-year measures. No differences were identified for time of day (A.M. versus P.M. class) or for the interaction of teacher and time of day. Among the process variables, &quot;confirming feedback&quot; was most frequently significant at the teacher level, and teachers in District A collectively accounted for 60% of the significant findings with respect to process variables. Findings suggest the importance of what happens in kindergarten classrooms, not merely the length of the school day. They also raise the question of whether differences between districts at the end of kindergarten will be evident in the early and middle elementary grades.

Changes in academic engaged time, active responding time, achievement, and student attitude were assessed, along with information from tutor evaluations. Subjects, nine intervention and eight control students with mild handicaps, in grades three-five, participated in the study over an 11-week period, with intervention subjects receiving at least 36 20-minute sessions with reading tutors during that time. The CISSAR (Code for Instructional Structure and Student Academic Response) observation system was used to obtain data on quantity of student responding time. Observations indicated significantly greater active academic responding (particularly reading aloud)  and academic engaged time when students were with tutors, as well as significantly less inappropriate off-task behavior. During the intervention period, higher inappropriate off-task behavior was observed when the student was not with the tutor during reading time. Follow-up observations of intervention students without tutors revealed that changes in responses were not maintained. Changes over time were not found in achievement or in student attitude measures. Tutor evaluations suggested the possibility of gains in aspects of reading not measured by standardized tests (e.g., expression), as well as several improvements for students in social-emotional areas.

Subjects, 40 undergraduate volunteers recruited from education classes, read a 2100-word excerpt from the novel &quot;Buffalo Chief&quot; by Jean and Paul Annixter. Students read a brief practice story to become familiar with the computer's presentation of the text, followed by the experimental passage. For both passages, the text was presented so that although an entire &quot;page&quot; of text was present on the screen (so that the reader could get information regarding word and paragraph lengths), only one line was readable at a time. The reader controlled which line of text was legible. After reading the experimental passage,  subjects reported any images or emotional reactions they experienced while reading the story. Finally, students rated their imagery and emotional responses. For the rating task, the story was again presented on the computer, one paragraph at a time. Beneath each paragraph, rating scales appeared on which readers rated their imagery and emotional responses to the paragraph on five-point Likert-type scales of imagery and affect. Findings, directly compared to those of previous research investigating imagery and emotional response, suggested that imagery and affect ratings are more reliable and replicable than some reading researchers have suspected. Findings demonstrated readers experience both imagery and emotional reactions that are interrelated and can be reliably studied. One figure is  included. (MM)",

        "description":"Literature can be used effectively in working with remedial readers to develop their vocabulary and comprehension skills. Three areas need to be addressed when working with remedial readers: (1) the concept of &quot;reading&quot; is usually underdeveloped with remedial students; (2) many remedial students have lowered self-concepts; and (3) many remedial readers do not have a wide range of reading interests. When working with remedial readers, negative attitudes toward reading may be turned around simply by adjusting the curriculum which is presented to them and taking into account the psychological needs of the students. To do this, teachers can take the first step by administering an interest inventory to remedial students. After the administration of the interest inventory, the teacher  should then categorize the students' responses and compile a list of books that could be used in the classroom to accommodate students' interests. To develop vocabulary skills, students can illustrate the meanings of new words, or play matching games on classroom bulletin boards. For comprehension, students can write endings for stories they are reading, engage in cloze activities, or play games that require them to answer questions concerning the plot of a story. By incorporating literature into the remedial curriculum and focusing on books which include topics of interest to students, the teacher can enhance the students' sense of control over the reading situation.

Reading difficulty was systematically manipulated at the microstructure and macrostructure processing levels. Results supported the prediction of qualitative changes in the way the meaning is represented by different age groups in different text conditions which are related to the amount and kinds of inferential processes on which the summaries were based.

Children in both grades received traditional reading instruction from basal reading series reflecting a whole-word approach to initial reading instruction. All children in the study spelled the same set of 40 words. Phonemic awareness was measured using the GKR Test of Phonemic Awareness, an oral test consisting of six subtests--phonemic  segmentation, blending, deletion of first phoneme, deletion of last phoneme, substitution of first phoneme, and substitution of last phoneme. Word specific information was measured using a test containing 60 two-alternative, forced-choice items. One alternative was a correct spelling for the word. The other was a phonetically legitimate though incorrect spelling. Children were instructed to circle the correct spelling for each word as it was pronounced by the researcher. Findings suggested that in first-graders, phonemic awareness had a more powerful effect, indicating that spelling at this level is more of a sequential, encoding process. By third grade, word-specific information exerted stronger influence on spelling, suggesting that children at this level spell using memorized  associations. (MM)",

        "description":"Standardized tests represent one way of obtaining assessment information. Yet in recent years educators and the public have voiced concerns about an overriding emphasis on tests and test scores. Pressure to &quot;teach to the test&quot; means that not enough time is spent on higher order thinking and literacy skills because minimal competencies have become the focus of the curriculum rather than one aspect of the educational program. These concerns are substantial; standardized testing of young children is an even more problematic practice. Some states are already responding to the problems associated with early childhood testing. Statewide testing of young children's reading and writing in Texas is accomplished through the first grade Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills (TEAMS)  test, a multiple-choice, standardized instrument that assesses minimal competency in nine reading and four writing skills. A majority of Texas principals, teachers, and supervisors feel that this standardized test has had a negative effect on curriculum and teaching, and research studies and experiences in other states mirror these conclusions. Therefore, the elimination of the present first grade assessment program using TEAMS is recommended. The state should insure that a high quality, developmentally appropriate literacy assessment program be developed and implemented, with the following goals: (1) knowledge and skills assessed would reflect classic and current research on early childhood literacy learning; (2) assessment procedures would be designed to fit with early childhood  literacy teaching practices; and (3) methods for gathering assessment data would include observation and performance samples of children's work under normal classroom conditions as well as test-like situations.

        "description":"A three-year study is testing the hypothesis that learning about American minority ethnic literature produces grief, and is assessing the effects of changing the teaching and content of the course to make the best possible use of those feelings. Classroom experience in teaching a consistently popular course in minority literature revealed unusual classroom difficulties, resulting in the hypothesis that students were experiencing intense psychological responses involving the typical forms of grief: anger, sorrow, bargaining, guilt, and denial. In the fall of 1987, preliminary data was gathered through an informal protocol (freewriting about the class) several times during the quarter. Evidence of the various forms of grief can be seen in these student writing samples. In the fall  of 1988, a more formal protocol instrument was administered six times during the quarter. These protocols will be assessed by trained readers, and the results evaluated using non-parametric statistical methods. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) expressions of grieving behavior change in relation to the content of a course; and (2) students move toward acceptance and preparation for social action by the end of the course. In the fall of 1989, if results warrant this change, students in the course will be told about its psychological dimensions and will be encouraged to assess their feelings in those terms. The course has had useful secondary effects, inspiring various forms of activism as well as resulting in students taking far more control over their education. The grief resulting from  ethnic literature classes probably reflects a positive process of growth. (SR)",

Yet peer groups are often marked more by inhibition and constraint than by collaboration, with students resisting both giving and receiving critiques. The distinguishing characteristic of peer critiquing is that it is coercive: it increases observation (a student's work is seen more often) and consequently discipline (which will be internalized, whether accurate or not). Teachers must recognize that the architecture of peer critiquing inherently operates at cross-purposes with their objectives for collaborative learning, and then develop the methodology to foster genuine collaboration within  such groups. Otherwise, peer critiquing will be more likely to imprison than to empower. (SR)",

These issues include postmodern thought, higher level thinking processes, introducting conceptual conflict and arousal, motivation, and integrating the writing process into the psychology curriculum. Each issue is briefly discussed and then a pedagogy designed to integrate it into a strategy for teaching a human development theories class is presented. The paper includes a study that used adaptation and application of relativistic and constructionist viewpoints to introduce conceptual conflict into the teaching of these classes. Subjects of the study were graduate education majors working on Master's and Specialist's degrees in Teacher Education, Home Economics,  or School Psychology. The strategy employed by the student-subjects describes a solution using the medium of writing, not only the traditional answers to essay questions, but also the writing of the very questions themselves. The paper discusses an additional concern, which has been to challenge and foster high level cognitive processes by encouraging the integration, synthesis, evaluation, and analysis of knowledge.

Subjects were 48 college freshmen enrolled in developmental reading/study strategy courses at two state universities. Results indicated that PORPE appears to offer content area instructors a comprehensive strategy which can help their students prepare for multiple choice and essay exams, a strategy which holds considerable promise for high risk students. These results generally  corroborate those of the first study in demonstrating that PORPE is a comprehensive study strategy system which can facilitate student learning of psychology concepts, regardless of whether they are presented in recognition or recall formats.

The three subjects--of varied educational backgrounds--discussed questions associated with a novel over the LAN in a recursive style, providing a positive social context for collaboration in a teacher-structured context. In a student-structured context, the emphasis was on the product (a collaborative essay) rather than on the process (analyzing text). The context and process of the collaboration changed because the focus of the task changed. The LAN was only used at the end to \"hook\" the separately written pieces of the essay  together and not to negotiate the separate tasks. Findings suggest possibilities for visualizing a variety of ways in which the collaborative writing process might occur; may help instructors see the advantages of collaborative writing in a course; and suggest a way to study collaborative groups to find out what they actually do.

There are three assignments that can be particularly useful to explain the view of writing as an extra-disciplinary activity: (1) studying a prose writer of the student's choice; (2) writing a personal research paper; and (3) analyzing the structure of knowledge in the student's own discipline. There are several biases that will inform responses to the students' investigations, such as truth cannot, ultimately be caught; good writing will create believable demonstrations of what it is that has been captured; and really good writing can fool a person. The writing course is the best  place in which to learn about those values the university holds most dear--the objective pursuit of truth and the relativity of knowledge--and to examine the nature and validity of those same values.

        "description":"The best way to understand and appreciate the forms and structures of autobiography is through the creation of lifewriting stories--memoirs, portraits, reminiscences, anecdotes, family histories, etc., which provide entry points for exploration in life experiences. Lifewriting texts provide the best point of penetration for the developing reader to come to understand not merely the nature of the autobiographical genre, but also to move towards more developed and sophisticated responses to literature in general. An examination of the research on autobiographical writing can lead to a greater understanding of how writers create the illusion of memory in the creation of a literary &quot;self.&quot; In a lifewriting class the move from writing to reading is inevitable. The collaborative mode  of composition presents the individual writer with a variety of texts in which other writers have tackled similar methodological questions in regard to getting their life stories down on paper. Initially each participant reads to discover alternative forms of presentation. Within the confines of the lifewriting group the texts that are read, appreciated, and criticized are fairly short and simple texts written by the other members of the group. But the skills and attitudes learned in this situation have a natural carry-over to the reading of more sophisticated life stories and memoirs in published texts. The structure which brings people together to write about their own experiences and share their reading and writing is very close to the type of primary classroom now labeled &quot;whole  language.&quot; (Thirty-seven references are attached.)

Data were also collected on students' self-efficacy, topic-knowledge organization, task-related persistence, behavior, essay characteristics, and students' responses to the instructional/writing episodes. While the results emerging from this study were highly complex, the  major finding indicated the importance of instructional support in explaining the students' writing-task engagement.

It is often the case as well that the writing and reading demands of school differ from those of nonschool writing and reading activities, and that the literacy skills emphasized in school do not, moreover, coincide with those needed or desired in the working world. Recent scholarship on writing and reading outside the school provides the vehicle for exploration of the relatedness of reading and writing as social practices and consideration of the implications of this social view of literacy outside of school for reading and writing instruction in  school. The areas of scholarship examined in depth are: (1) recent research on young children's early reading and writing, often called \"emergent literacy\"; (2) linguistic patterns children acquire in their development of spoken language and the relation of those patterns to writing activities in school; and (3) the similarities and differences between literacy demands in school and at work.

        "description":"How writing teachers get students from the personal-experience theme, with its many colloquial terms, to the formal essay seems to be a national issue. Teachers are under pressure to do the thing that colleges seem to value most--to teach the kind of essay that corresponds to term papers or essay questions. Colleges emphasize this because it is part of their testing program, and this pressure passes all the way down to the elementary school. This tends to determine the bent of the writing curriculum. The purpose is to aim at ways of teaching other kinds of writing that will, at the same time, prepare for what colleges want. There are two main bridges from the personal narrative to various kinds of informal and formal essays. One is by way of intervening kinds of discourse that  students might practice in between personal writing and essay writing. The other way is by &quot;parlaying&quot; personal writing directly into essay. A good idea is for writing teachers to use former students' writing to work with current students. A selection of student writing from elementary school through college shows a wide repertoire of writing possibilities. (Includes a figure breaking down the main kinds of writing into five groupings.

Forty randomly selected narrative and 40 explanatory passages originally scored holistically as part of a Canadian provincial writing assessment program were reanalyzed with the Writer's Workbench software.

Subjects were 2,532 high school seniors who took the anchor form of the Writing Skills Test in the spring of 1987 and 699 adult high  school non-completers between the ages of 17 and 19. Results indicated the nature of writing skill measured by this test to be a single construct reflecting generalized proofreading/editing skills. No support was found for the view that separate item-type methods factors accounted for variability of performance on the multiple-choice portion of the GED test. This study provided an empirical field-based illustration of the use of CFA procedures to evaluate the factor structure of multiple-trait, multiple-method data and to test for the invariance of plausible measurement models over multiple groups.

        "description":"Teachers often view basic writers as manifestations of three different problems: problems with usage forms, problems with discourse forms, and problems with thought. The first type consists of problems of standard versus nonstandard English usage, and is concerned with error. Others see basic writers' problems as ones of discourse forms and conventions. This view would remediate basic writers by teaching them to emulate models of discourse. A third view of writers suggests that they need to assume different ways of thinking, of examining problems. But basic writers can think in any way which is appropriate for their situation. The same intellectual skills which served them in an inner-city neighborhood or rural farming community can serve them in an academic community. They do,  however, need to learn to translate their thought from outside-the-academy views to inside-the-academy views. Teachers need to establish connections between these disparate subcultures in order to translate between levels of intensity within the areas of commitment. This translation can be facilitated through more extensive use of peer groups in the basic writing class. Through peer interaction, basic writers begin to understand that good writing allows members of one subculture, of one discourse community, to communicate with members of others. (MM)",

Subjects were three New York City elementary school teachers participating in the Columbia University Teachers College Writing Project (a coordinated effort to involve teachers and students in the writing process in the classroom setting). The study describes each teacher in turn: (1) characterizing their writing conferences, including strategies for conferring; (2) demonstrating how teachers' conceptions of the purposes of the conference shaped their interactions with  students; and (3) demonstrating how these conceptions changed over time. Three semi-structured interviews and three classroom observations made over one school year were used to gather data about each teacher. Results indicated that although the three teachers started at different points with differing conceptions of the purposes of the writing conferences, they progressed toward a common point reflecting a balance between encouraging students to own their writing and finding a way to intervene to encourage growth in the writing of students. Movement towards this balance was reflected on three dimensions: conceptions of the purposes of conferences; the content of conferences; and teacher-student interactions during the conference.

        "description":"Self-assessment occurred daily in the act of learning in a professional writing class, which met in a computer-networked writing classroom. Strategies for self-assessment were based on James Britton's &quot;expressive writing&quot; and Peter Elbow's believing game. Students recorded and assessed this active learning in a Writer's Notebook (a journal with a neutral name). The Writer's Notebook provided a place for them to discover, to experiment, and to make meaning for themselves and about professional writing; to organize their ideas; and to see progress as professional writers. Its entries also included metacognition, cognition, and feelings. Students responded to five types of prompts: metacognition, practice writing, response to reading, dialogue, and assessment. These prompts were  designed primarily to facilitate writing to learn rather than to serve as prewriting for final products. The teacher's reading and responding to content reinforced students' ownership of their writing and encouraged them. Influenced by the Adlerian distinction of encouragement and praise, the language of the believing game became significant. The Writer's Notebook also became a dialogue journal. As self-assessment continued during the semester, students increased their self-esteem, empowered themselves, increased their confidence about their writing and computers, developed control of their writing behavior and feelings, and simultaneously improved their professional writing. (Appendixes consist of a Writer's Notebook guide, prompts, and a handout entitled &quot;What Is a Response?&quot;)  (Author/MM)",

Think-aloud protocols were used to identify and propose problems in the texts. Results indicated subjects made a minimal numbers of miscues which they seldom corrected, that most of these miscues were word substitutions, and that most of these substitutions did not alter the syntax or meaning of the sentence.

        "description":"The desire for consistent judging criteria is essential to the learning process of forensics students. When evaluating the After Dinner Speaking (ADS) judges need to focus on a variety of criteria. Some of these criteria transcend event descriptions while others are indigenous primarily to ADS. The topic chosen for the event should demonstrate that the student picked a topic that he or she was interested in and was suitable for him or her, one that had a universal audience appeal, and one that could be addressed within the realm of good taste. The topic or approach to the topic should be original. The structure and delivery of an ADS speech should be evaluated in the same way other public speeches are evaluated, with attention being paid to sound thematic development, the use of  previews, reviews and a well organized body, with special attention paid to language, enthusiasm, timing, and flexibility. The ADS, while its main distinction is the use of humor, should contain a serious point that is woven throughout the speech rather than being tacked on at the end. Finally, since humor is a main ingredient in the After Dinner Speech, judges should be able to evaluate it objectively, not letting personal likes and dislikes dominate the evaluation. For their part, students should not be obsessed with getting nonstop laughs, thus sacrificing other elements of the speech such as the structure or serious point. (Fifteen references are attached.)

        "description":"In an effort to deal with a single aspect of a multifaceted interaction between technical and social discourse, this essay examines the movement of scientific discourse between the realms of politics and science. The paper addresses the effects on scientific methodology wrought by the Nazi employment of science as a basis for racial politics. The discussion focuses on characterizations of science by Nazi scientists and propagandists at the time. Analysis of these primary sources, the paper argues, indicates that as scientific discourse becomes appropriated for audiences and purposes beyond the arena of technical scientific disputes, the nature of scientific activity alters to accommodate these changes. The paper points out that on a more general level, when the discourse of  specialists is employed in political contexts and finds a broader audience than other specialists, rhetorically induced methodological consequences ensue which alter the nature of the specialized field. The paper concludes that if the worst horrors in human history were conducted in the name of science or for the sake of a biological ideal, then the greatest service rhetorical analysis can render is to lay the groundwork for prevention through understanding.

Susan Jarratt, focusing on revisionary historiography, argued for &quot;historiography in the subjunctive mode,&quot; suggesting that the Sophists have something to teach about the value of redefinition, discontinuity, and indeterminacy in rewriting rhetorical history. James Berlin argued for plurality--a search for and recognition of ideologies in opposition to whatever dominant rhetoric emerged as &quot;the winner&quot; at a given historical moment. Both have shown today  how the failure to recognize the contributions of marginalized groups diminished rhetoricians as a community of scholars. When the language in which rhetoricians choose to write is a source of disempowerment or exclusion they are further diminished. Once again it is hard to ignore Richard Weaver's emphasis on the &quot;whole man&quot; and his advocacy of &quot;mastery.&quot; There is irony in the clear elevation of the masculine to a status of preferability in a passage about the fully human as the object of rhetoric. Such recognition helps to illuminate why it ultimately matters whether rhetoric is cast in the language of masculinity or femininity, because rhetoric is evaluative and as a consequence cannot help broadcasting its ethical basis while it has its impact on receivers.

Subjects were 59 male and 71 female undergraduates (ranging in age from 17-49) enrolled in a basic public speaking course at a midwestern university during the 1986-87 academic year. The Personal Report of Public Speaking Apprehension (PRPSA) which measures exclusively public speaking anxiety was administered the first week of the semester, three weeks prior to the first required speech--the informative speech. The PRPSA also was administered the last week of the course. Two treatment conditions were defined in testing the hypotheses: (1) specific delivery instruction in which subjects received specific prior instruction in three class sessions, discussing the role of delivery in public  speaking and learning various methods of delivery including similar verbal and non-verbal elements; and (2) general delivery instruction which consisted of a brief introduction to the role of delivery in effective public speaking with limited attention given to the basic elements of rate and volume and a reminder to students that their first speech should be extemporaneously delivered. Results indicated that anxiety level decreased when delivery instruction was provided to high apprehensives prior to their first graded speech in a basic public speaking course. However, learning for speech-anxious subjects may be influenced by an instructor's ability to create a safe and supportive environment. Findings support the value of testing various methods of structuring the speaking experiences of  apprehensive students. (Three tables of data are included, and 30 references are attached.) (RAE)",

        "description":"To investigate whether a previewing technique, transferred to the television medium, enhances children's comprehension of a televised story, two studies developed a one and one-half minute edited video, designed using a variation of Ausubel's advance organizers and constructed to provide children with a brief overview of the basic plot structure before seeing the televised story, &quot;Soup and Me.&quot; The first study examined the effects of previewing with 54 second graders in Boston using a multiple-choice test of 20 items, which assessed their recall of central, incidental, and inferential story information. Results indicated that viewing a preview before a televised story significantly increased students' comprehension of plot-essential information, but did not influence their  ability to infer from the story. The second study examined previewing's effects on free recall with 39 first graders. Those in the preview group recalled the episodic structure of the story significantly better than the control group. Previews appeared to act primarily as a cuing device, drawing children's attention to central aspects of the story. Results indicated that previewing may be an effective mediational technique for enhancing children's comprehension and retention of plot-essential information from a televised story. (Three tables of data are included; an appendix provides the macrostructure for the 19 episodes of &quot;Soup and Me,&quot; and 28 references are attached.) (MM)",

        "description":"To determine the public's responses to the 1988 presidential debates, the System for the Multiple Level Observation of Groups (SYMLOG) was used to analyze how values positions connected to interpersonal styles. Subjects, 157 students from either a mid-sized Southern university or a large Midwestern university and 21 non-students drawn from people who had gathered to watch the first debate at the Democratic headquarters in a mid-size southern city, responded to a set of questions. Findings confirmed that: (1) the winner of the debate was predicted by post-debate preference after the first debate; (2) the winner of the debate was predicted by perceptions of the candidate that projected the strongest personal image, the greatest credibility, the most logical arguments, and the  strongest emotional appeals; (3) vote intention was predicted by the SYMLOG value positions; (4) perceptions of strongest personal image, candidate credibility, and candidate ability to use logical argument and present emotional appeals were predicted by SYMLOG value positions; and (5) actual voting choice was predicted by the post-debate preference after the first debate. Findings also showed that if subjects did not watch the debates, they were not able to report their perceptions of which candidates won the debates and that the self-report SYMLOG dimension did not predict one of the candidates.

        "author":["Herbeck, Dale A."],
        "description":"Michael Dukakis lost the presidential campaign debates of 1988 (or at least failed to capitalize as much as he might have) because he understood the debates to be genuine debates. Consequently, Dukakis acted as a debater generating an image of himself as a &quot;benevolent technocrat,&quot; which was an error. It must be pointed out that the presidential debates and real academic debates are quite different for several reasons. For example, the real controversy in presidential debates is between the candidates and their media questioners, as opposed to being between the two candidates. It was also obvious that Dukakis and his handlers did not appreciate the specialized nature of these debates. An analysis of the questions and answers that Dukakis gave showed that the image he was trying to  project, that of a benevolent technocrat, was disastrous. He showed no emotion and feeling, he did not muster outrage at the hypothetical rape and murder of his wife, and he was unable to portray himself as a leader. The failure of Dukakis' strategy is significant for several reasons. It suggests that the 1988 presidential debates were more an exercise in image management than debating, and it illustrates why &quot;traditional&quot; debate between the presidential candidates is extremely unlikely. What this means is that the debates should probably be appreciated for what they are, political events exemplifying democratic traditions open to everyone, rather than examples of the traditional conception of a debate.

        "description":"The value system of a school is a major factor affecting the teacher's working conditions, but public discourse on educational reform tends to avoid serious discussion of the most deeply embedded values in our educational system. This absence of serious reflection on values limits consideration of alternatives for improving both education and the quality of work in schools. Accordingly, this paper draws on personal involvement with the International School Improvement Project and on literature reviews to explore, in a cross-cultural context, some of the ways in which basic cultural values, professional values, and community values may affect the lives of teachers. The section on cultural values discusses and compares norms of homo/heterogeneity among schools, attitudes toward  parental values and choice, and views of stability and change. The section on professional values discusses and compares the view of the teacher and the view of the school leader in various countries. The section on community values begins with a definition of value-cohesive and value-fragmented communities, and then discusses the effect of community cohesiveness or fragmentation on teachers. A discussion follows of the way in which value issues are framed in communities characterized by coalitions or those characterized by interest groups. The role of values in determining educational structures and functions in various cultures has implications for policy and practice, which are discussed in the conclusion. Notes and a bibliography are included. (TE)",

Employment cases of particular interest included the setting aside on jurisdictional issues of a court order requiring southern and border  states to bring their higher education systems into compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A class of female faculty were decertified because of the decentralized structure and employment decision-making at a university. There were numerous cases in the areas of tenure awards and termination of tenured faculty for cause. Student litigation cases were varied, with loan and scholarship defaults continuing to be the bulk of cases in the financial aid area. Liability cases such as alcohol consumption resulting in death and fraternities serving alcohol to minors were among those before the courts. (MLF)",

Central tendency statistics and significance tests were used where appropriate. Findings revealed a clearly identifiable path to the superintendency--from coach to principal to central office administrator--with some variation in the particulars of the path, especially for appointed administrators. For instance, appointed female superintendents' career paths differed from those of appointed male superintendents. None had been high  school administrators, nor coaches, although almost all had been central office administrators. The results suggest truth to the notion that coaching and high school administration are routes to the superintendency. (JAM)",

In addition, this paper analyzes the properties of secondary schools that shape principals' work; reviews their daily tasks; describes models of instructional leadership; delineates specific ways that high school principals influence school and classroom processes to shape teaching and learning; discusses how principals build school cultures and foster school improvement; and gives specific instances of the ways some principals mold teaching and learning in suburban and urban settings. Several conclusions emerge from this discussion. First, principals share  their instructional leadership position with assistant principals, department chairs, and teachers. Second, instructional leadership in high schools often attends to both the technical side of the school (by configuring and managing the instructional process) and to the cultural side (by molding the norms, values, and beliefs of teachers). Third, principals shape improvement through planned change efforts that incorporate systematic and organized processes that draw on the resources of administrators, teachers, and department chairs. Fourth, principals can cultivate and develop instructional leadership in others. Fifth, principals may exercise instructional leadership through small individual actions. Finally, instructional leadership can be enhanced by fostering a sense of shared clarity  of purpose and mission among all school constituents. (JAM)",

Next, questionnaires were sent to 5,402 teachers to gather information on the labor supply. Twenty-two tables show data from the questionnaires.

The teachers' questionnaire, with 75% return rate, yielded information on teachers' retirement plans. Included are tables showing the number and percentage of South Carolina public school teachers who plan to leave public school teaching prior to retirement, along with percentage data on their planned activities, number of years prior to retirement, and responses to various new retirement system options. Seven major conclusions were drawn from the study, suggesting that early retirement options will have a very modest effect on the labor supply, but that improved fringe benefits might make the South Carolina public school system more attractive to potential employees.

        "description":"This study is a history of the societal-problems approach in social studies education as revealed in secondary school social studies textbooks used in Problems of Democracy courses from 1895 to 1985. The central thesis is that the definition of the problems approach and the problems selected for study by educators as illustrated by the textbooks reflect their definitions of the \"worthy society,\" their values, hopes, fears, and political beliefs, as well as the crucial issues of the day and underlying power relationships in American society. Beyond explaining the origins, development, and decline of the problems approach, the study includes a critical analysis of the \"problems\" selected for study, textbook space allocation, treatment of specific problems that reflect ideology, and  the conception of a problem put forth by various educators. The study used quantitative methods to examine 135 textbooks in order to determine the average number of text pages devoted to 60 \"problems\" falling into 7 major problem areas during each time period: skills, citizenship, personal, international, social, economic, and political. The central finding of the study is that treatment of societal problems was determined primarily by the internal norms of educators; their values, educational philosophy, and political beliefs; and their perception of the problems of American society.

The Carnegie report gives a bold new outline for improving teachers' roles in the schools by greatly strengthening their decision-making role and advocating a much more decentralized school organization. This paper presents a discourse on several critical issues that will be necessary to consider as the Carnegie report becomes a workable model. A major focus of this report is &quot;empowering teachers&quot; to have a greater decision-making role in schools. This paper discusses the importance of restructuring schools and attempts to analyze the changes necessary by categorizing the change at three levels of education: schools, school  districts, and the state. Several administrative task areas are analyzed at each of these levels: management, fiscal, legal, and curriculum. A final section discusses issues in the training of future administrators.

It reports a new willingness on the part of some leaders to share leadership responsibilities in a way that does not diminish, but in fact enhances, their ability to lead schools to their full potential. The paper proposes broad political empowerments to change the direction of American schools at the expense of bureaucratic maintenance and intellectual conformity.

As planned, the academy will involve a 3-year cycle. Each of the first 2 years of the academy will include an intensive summer training session in August followed by monthly sessions focusing on various aspects of administration and school improvement. The academy is taught and coordinated by a faculty member from Emporia State University. In addition,  nationally recognized experts in the area of school improvement are invited to address the academy. A planning committee, made up of representatives from each of the participating school districts, meets regularly to evaluate the pace, content, and direction of the academy. Administrators participating in the academy sessions can elect to receive graduate credit for work-related study. Networking between administrators in the academy has given those with similar job assignments opportunities to work together on problem solving, to share ideas they have tried in their schools, and to discuss mutual concerns.

An introductory section provides a brief history of the psychosocial rehabilitation movement, proposes a conceptual framework, and highlights existing evaluation publications which may be of use to program administrators. The next five sections describe components of a comprehensive evaluation strategy, focusing on the following dimensions of psychosocial rehabilitation programs: (1) input (agency mission, client characteristics and needs, staff competencies, financial  condition); (2) process (program practices, program connectedness, match to need); (3) output (productivity evaluation, staff productivity); (4) outcome (client satisfaction, family satisfaction, client outcomes); (5) output/outcome (cost effectiveness, cost/benefit analysis). Within each section, relevant literature is reviewed, specific techniques described, methodological concerns aired, and resource constraints noted. The final section discusses the implications of evaluation, including the uses of information to improve services, the role of &quot;inside&quot; versus &quot;outside&quot; evaluation, and the potential future directions that evaluation is likely to take.

Subjects were 88 children, aged 11-14, who were identified as developmentally dyslexic. The children were administered the Boder Test of Reading-Spelling Patterns (BTRSP) and the Quick Neurological Screening Test (QNST). The children were then cross-classified into three subtypes of reading-spelling patterns (dysphonetic, dyseidetic, and mixed) and three levels of neurological functioning (normal, suspicious, and highly suspicious) according to the criteria established by the BTRSP and the QNST.

The first study investigated the structure of adaptive behavior as a function of age, developmental level, and type of handicap through an exploratory factor analysis of both the individual items and the subscales of the &quot;Scales of Independent Behavior.&quot; Samples for the study consisted of 1,958 nonretarded individuals from preschool-age to adults, and 288 retarded individuals, aged 76 months to adults. The second study sought to extend a prior review of adaptive behavior factor analytic research through analysis of nine new studies and re-examination of seven sources. The third study explored the relationship between  adaptive behavior, maladaptive behavior, and intellectual/academic ability through the application of multivariate statistical methodology with subjects from the first study and 556 additional children in grades 1-8. Results of the three studies showed that adaptive behavior, maladaptive behavior, and intellectual/academic ability represent related but different constructs. Current psychoeducational assessment practices provide good coverage of conceptual intelligence, practical intelligence, and social/emotional adaptation, but are weak in the coverage of social intelligence.

Telephone interviews and questionnaire surveys were used to gather the data from various state agencies and selected county social service agencies. In the area of children's foster care, findings are presented on the number of children in foster care, foster children with handicaps, longitudinal trends in foster care, state-by-state changes in foster care placements, statewide management information systems for children, and foster care program operation. On the  topic of adult foster care, data are presented on the number of adults in foster care and the management of adult foster care programs. The report also describes specialized foster care and offers an assessment of the differential availability of foster care statistics at the state and county levels. Recommendations are offered to improve the quality of foster care data available. An appendix contains tables detailing, for each state, the number of children in foster care by type of placement and by type of disability (mental retardation; emotional disturbances; specific learning disability; hearing, visual, or speech impairments; and physical or health handicaps).

The report argues that traditionally institutionalized rehabilitation techniques, whether in education, vocational training, or sheltered employment, have tended not to encourage autonomy and independence and have tended to maintain disabled young people in a state of childhood. Reviewed are the stages of development in becoming an adult, such as socialization and peer groups, separation from parents, deinstitutionalization, and sexual relationships and marriage; the significance of work as the major proof of adult status; and adult status before the law. The negative consequences of labeling for the self-esteem and identity of  disabled persons are explored, along with methods for meeting special needs without the burden of negative labels. Three examples are described where the development of adult status is a central concern: (1) a specialized team of social workers, vocational training teachers, and a psychiatrist in Genova, Italy, work to train mentally disabled individuals for competitive employment; (2) individual counseling of an adolescent with Down Syndrome, helps her attain adult living and independence; and (3) mentally retarded young people are informed about the nature of their disability.

This paradigm is strongly rooted in the psychometric tradition and draws upon the \"medical model\" by defining characteristics or \"symptoms\" of giftedness and developing quantitative indices to precisely identify those students with that \"condition.\" The current paradigm is inadequate in three areas: (1) dimensions of ability are not fixed and predetermined in any person over time and circumstances, and cannot be predicted comprehensively by traditional intelligence tests; (2) identification practices are arbitrary and contrived; and (3) a single, fixed program is  provided for gifted students, relying on a resource room model and thus not offering opportunities for all students to learn and apply powerful learning and thinking tools. The traditional paradigm needs to give way to a broader, dynamic, growth-oriented view of the nature of giftedness. Identification should become more flexible, inclusive, and instruction-oriented. Schools should consider a broad range of instructional responses, designed to challenge all students to a greater degree. Implications of the new paradigm for research are outlined. (JDD)",

        "description":"The paper briefly describes the research foundations of the curriculum at the University of Tulsa (Oklahoma) School for Gifted Children with emphasis on the arts component. The school, serving children from 3 to 11 years of age, bases its curriculum in Enaction Theory originated by S. Ohlsson (1983). The theory stresses the enhancement of thinking through three steps: (1) developing a representational mental model, (2) manipulating that model, and (3) developing rules (heuristics) that lead to a strategy for problem solving. The Rainbow Day Curriculum is an entirely arts based curriculum which is conducted 1 day a week at the school. The program attempts to help students develop an appreciation of a broad spectrum of art work through critical evaluation of art work reproductions  representing the three approaches to art of imitationalism, emotionalism, and formalism. Included are a bibliography of 11 items and handouts describing a taxonomy of thinking based on enaction theory, the three approaches to art, and guidelines for art criticism. (DB)",

This high technology expert system was developed by experts in the areas of early childhood, psychology, speech pathology, and special education. IEPs are provided for ten handicapping conditions (blind, deaf, emotional disturbance, health impaired, hearing impaired, learning disabled, mental retardation, orthopedic impairment, speech/language deficits, and visual impairments) as well as the gifted condition. Users of the system screen the child using standard instruments and  submit data concerning chronological age, suspected handicapping condition, and developmental age/s. Data may be communicated by a telephone conference, mail, or direct computer link. Users receive a printout of goals and objectives accompanied by referenced curriculum, materials, and recommended activities. The rapid return of IEPs allows a child to receive and master several plans in a year. During the second and third years of operation over 5000 IEPs were implemented and over 800 hot line calls were made for purposes of crisis intervention, short term counseling, and other information services. The program serves Head Start Programs in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. (DB)",

Subjects were 144 right handed college students. Results supported previous experiments demonstrating the visual modality superior to the combined visual-haptic or the haptic modality alone in the learning of Braille symbols. However, the visual-haptic condition was superior to the haptic-visual study-test ratio condition. Better performance occurred for those who studied visually and for those who were tested visually. Other findings were that performance was inversely related to item complexity. Results tended to support a modified modality adeptness hypothesis which related performance to frequency of presentation  in the most adept modality. (DB)",

In the first study, sighted subjects (N=64) haptically examined each of a set of Braille symbols with their preferred or nonpreferred hand and immediately recalled the symbol by drawing it or calling out the number of each dot present. Neither the effect of hand used, response type, nor their interaction were significant. In the second study each of 16 subjects (all of whom were legally blind) examined the symbols with the preferred hand and orally reported the number of each dot present. Comparison with the previous experiment found a high degree of similarity between the two groups in number correct, type of error,  and relationship between item difficulty and number of dots. Findings indicate the same processes are operative in this task performance for both blind and sighted persons suggesting that research in perceptual, learning, and memory tasks with sighted subjects may be applicable to the visually impaired.

An analysis of the content of the publications from 1985-1987 was also undertaken, which involved counting each occurrence of terms related to  ethnic and multicultural concerns. Findings suggested that there were relatively few occurrences of the terms. &quot;Teaching Exceptional Children&quot; had very limited coverage of the topic.

To apply for the experiential learning program (ELP), applicants must have 2 years of full-time experience in a children's center or licensed day care home working with children between 12 weeks and 6 years of age, and read at the 10th grade level or higher. Steps in obtaining credit for experiential learning include the following: (1) the student completes a college application, a reading skills test, and a portfolio detailing his/her child care experiences and accomplishments and involvement in professional associations; (2) references are contacted for an assessment of the applicant's experience  and abilities; (3) the applicant is informed of the number of transfer credits granted, the competencies to be assessed through the ELP, and the measurement techniques for each competency; (4) the student receives learning modules for each required competency and completes them, often two or three at a time, in a specified order; (5) the student's prior knowledge determines how much additional time he/she must spend to complete assignments in the learning modules and prepare for mastery tests; (6) the student contacts the ELP instructor and arranges a date for testing and the submission of assignments; and (7) after the student has received credit for all of the competencies, he/she has completed the first year of the CCSC and may enroll for the second year. Benefits of the ELP include  students' ability to complete the program while working full time, costs based on the number of competencies that are challenged, a self-paced format, and the adaptability to students' schedules, place of residence, and needs.

One of the first activities of the Delaware Valley Trade Enhancement project was a survey of over 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses in the area to determine the type of international business programs that would best serve their needs. Survey responses indicated that many of the companies expected to expand their international activities within the next five years and that they wished to enhance their employees' knowledge and skills related to international business. Subsequently, an International Trade Series targeted to small businesses was initiated, including  workshops on &quot;Importing/Exporting for the Entrepreneur,&quot;&quot;How to Finance Your Exports Using Letters of Credit,&quot; and &quot;How to Successfully Ship Your Product for Export.&quot; A curriculum development component of the project resulted in the development of two international business courses, in-service programs for business faculty on international trade practices and issues, and the enhancement of the library's collection of materials on international trade. A final aspect of the project focused on strengthening relations with the National Luen-Lin Institute of Technology in Taiwan, the college's &quot;sister institution,&quot; and establishing links with Taiwanese trade organizations that could help small firms in Delaware Valley develop export businesses.

Learning communities address these problems, and the atomism of the disciplines, by bringing together people with related interests and giving them the opportunity to learn from each other. The term &quot;learning communities&quot; refers to a variety of approaches,  including the following: (1) freshman interest groups, such as those operating at the University of Oregon, which involve triads of courses focusing on such topics as &quot;The Human Environment in Art and Architecture&quot; and &quot;Pre-Health Sciences: Biology/Psychology&quot;; (2) learning clusters, such as LaGuardia Community College's &quot;Freedom and Seeing&quot; cluster of linked courses in English composition, research paper writing, introduction to philosophy, and introduction to art; (3) Federated Learning Communities involving three courses linked by a common theme and an integrative seminar taken by the teacher as well as the students; and (4) the Coordinated Study Model, in which teams of three or four faculty members plan the coordinated study of an over-arching theme in blocks of time that accommodate  lectures, discussions, field trips, and other activities.

The analyses focused mainly on the characteristics of students who received an associate degree or certificate in a vocational education program within 4 years of high school graduation. Study findings included the following: (1) only 12% of the HS&amp;B graduates who attended any postsecondary institution completed a vocational degree or certificate program; (2) among the 1980 high school seniors who completed a postsecondary program within 4 years of high school graduation, vocational  credentials were earned at a rate four times that of academic degrees; (3) HS&amp;B students completed vocational degrees at a higher rate than NLS students, but academic degrees at a lower rate; (4) most associate vocational degrees were completed at public two year colleges; (5) the most popular field of study for vocational program graduates was business, followed by technical and engineering studies and health for associate degree recipients, and trade and industry and health for certificate completers; (6) 40% of all credits earned by vocational degree completers were in academic subjects; (7) students with certificates earned slightly more than half as many credits as students completing vocational degree programs; and (8) the postsecondary credit patterns for those who completed  vocational certificate programs and those who completed academic degree programs did not change much between the early to middle 1970's and the early to middle 1980's. Technical notes, data tables, and a classification of postsecondary courses are included in the report. (JMC)",

Students who entered BCC for the first time in fall 1986 or fall 1987 intending to obtain a degree or certificate were selected for the study. Course grades in college-level mathematics and writing were compared for students placing below, just above, and well above passing on the ASSET placement test. Study findings included the following: (1) in the writing course, students placing just higher than the passing standard tended to withdraw from class at higher rates than those who scored below passing or those who scored well above passing; (2) 27% of the  students who scored below passing on the writing test circumvented remedial writing instruction, enrolled directly in the college-level writing course, and successfully completed the college-level course at a higher rate than students who first took the remedial course; (3) students who scored just above passing on the writing test, and yet took the remedial course, passed the college-level course at a higher rate than students who did not take the remedial course first; and (4) 11% of the students who scored below passing on the mathematics placement test took no remedial courses, and, of these, 32% successfully completed their college-level mathematics course. Based on study findings, it was concluded that mandatory placement into or out of remedial course work based on placement test  scores with questionable predictive validity may not be the ideal solution for students.

        "description":"When the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) was mandated in Florida, a schedule of incremental increases in the required passing scores was legislated. The 1986 passing standards were scheduled to be increased in 1989. This change was projected to reduce by half the number of students admitted to upper-level status at Florida's colleges. A proposal was put forth by the Commissioner of Education to increase the standards on a more gradual basis. The two reports contained in this document analyze the potential impact of the various proposals on Broward Community College (BCC) students. The first report examines the passing rate of BCC students who took the CLAST in March 1989, utilizing 1986 standards, the Commissioner's proposed interim standards, and the standards  originally scheduled for implementation in 1989. The report indicates that under 1986 standards the passing rate for BCC students was 79%. Under the originally proposed standards, this figure would drop to 36.5%, while under the Commissioner's proposal, the passing rate would be 58%. The second report examines the March 1986 CLAST scores by ethnic group. The report indicates that while 86% of BCC's White non-Hispanic students passed all four CLAST subtests, only 59% of the Black non-Hispanic students, 60% of the Hispanic students, and 44% of the Asian students did so. These figures dropped to 64%, 37%, 42%, and 28%, respectively, under the Commissioner's proposed standards and to 41%, 27%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, under the originally proposed 1989 standards.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Broward Community College (BCC) to compare the performance on the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) of examinees with college preparatory experience to that of examinees without this experience. Data were drawn from CLAST tapes for the 1988-89 academic year and from BCC's admissions file. Passing rates for each CLAST subtest were calculated for examinees who had successfully completed any college preparatory course and for those who had not. In 1989, the passing rate for both groups combined was 78.7%. However, 87% of the examinees who did not have college preparatory experience passed all four subtests of the CLAST, while only 68% of those who had taken preparatory coursework succeeded in passing all subtests. In order to assess the effects of  proposed increases in passing standards, the June 1989 CLAST results were recalculated. The results showed that the more moderate proposed increase would allow only about one-half of all examinees to pass the CLAST. Nearly two-thirds of those examinees who had no college preparatory experience would still pass, in sharp contrast to the 40% passing rate for college preparatory students. If the more stringent set of standards were used, the passing rate would drop to 20% for those with college preparatory experience and to 40% for those without. Graphs showing passing rates by subtest for each set of standards are included. (JMC)",

Chapter 1 identifies the social forces that contributed to the development and expansion of community colleges and the continuing changes in institutional purposes. Chapter 2 examines the shifting patterns of student characteristics and goals, the reasons for the predominance of part-time attendance, participation and achievement among minority students, attrition issues, and recent moves toward student assessment. Chapter 3 draws on national data to illustrate the differences between full- and part-time faculty and discusses issues related to tenure, salary, workload, faculty evaluation, moonlighting,  burnout, and job satisfaction. Chapter 4 reviews the changes that have taken place in college management as a result of changes in institutional size, the advent of collective bargaining, reductions in available funds, and changes in governance and control. Chapter 5 describes various funding patterns and their relationship to organizational shifts. Chapter 6 discusses the rise of learning resource centers and the maintenance of stability in instructional forms in spite of the introduction of a host of reproducible instructional media. Chapter 7 considers student personnel functions, including counseling, guidance, recruitment, retention, orientation, and extracurricular activities. Chapter 8 traces the rise of occupational education, as it has moved from a peripheral to a central  position in the curriculum. Chapter 9 focuses on remedial and developmental programs and addresses the controversies surrounding student assessment and placement. Chapter 10 deals with adult and continuing education, lifelong learning, and community services. Chapters 11 and 12 examine curricular trends in the liberal arts and general education, highlighting problems and proposing solutions. Chapter 13 addresses the philosophical and practical questions that have been raised about the transfer function and the community college's role in enhancing student progress toward higher degrees. Finally, chapter 14 offers projections based on current trends in student and faculty demographics, college organization, curriculum, instruction, and student services. (JMC)",

Subjects were approximately 100 elementary school students who were followed during the first three grades. At the end of first grade, relationships were found between ambiguity detection, reading, and writing. Psychometric measures correlated reading with various degrees of strength, but were poor predictors of writing. Reading was firmly related to writing. At the end of second grade, analyses identified two writing measures, language reception, reading, and additional writing scores as descriptors of communication evaluation. The major contrast between first and second year findings lay in the order of entry of discriminating  variables. The similarity of first and second year findings was striking, with several psychometric measures failing to contribute to the equation. In the third year of the study, a novel index of the children's text analysis skills was developed and administered. This consisted of an adventure options story in which a duplicitous guide provides directions with multiple possible intentions. (RH)",

Discussion focuses first on individual contributions as mediators of joint cognitive activity, and second on the way participants' shared social history may influence the social generation of cognitive opportunity. Findings suggest that the process by which adults, particularly parents, influence children's learning is not yet clearly established. Nor is it known just what aspects of interpsychological functioning regulate the interactional process and potentially affect the intrapsychological outcome for the child. It is argued that it is time for cognitive developmental research to move beyond the  assertion that social context is a mechanism of cognitive development and begin to examine the operations of social context that promote, or perhaps impede, cognitive growth.

The discussion of child-related issues centers on development of an understanding of the ways in which children watch and learn from television. Discussion of message-related issues deals with the nature and extent of portrayals that hold important implications for possible adverse effects on child viewers, the structure and economics of the broadcast industry, and the intersection of child characteristics and television content.  Policy-related issues center on development of an understanding of the fundamental structure of broadcast regulation, on familiarizing students with a historical perspective on past policy actions in the area of children and television, and on the examination of current issues under consideration by policymakers.

The act mandates that appropriate educational services be made available to at least some welfare recipients as part of the effort to help those receiving public assistance become self-supporting. The document: (1) highlights aspects of the FSA that are relevant to both the education and the public welfare communities; (2) describes the opportunities that FSA offers for both systems to meet their own and shared goals for populations at risk; (3) emphasizes the importance and benefits of collaboration between education and the human services in the implementation of FSA; and (4) offers  suggestions that may abet the implementation process. Appended are a summary of the major provisions of the FSA, an overview of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, resources for additional information and assistance, and a reference list.

        "description":"A study was made of relationships between particular family dynamics and the well-being of children with disabled siblings. Attention focused on the relation to children's adjustment of three issues emphasized in the literature: (1) children's family responsibilities, including sibling caregiving and household tasks, which may be more demanding for children with disabled siblings; (2) potential stresses arising from the sibling relationship; and (3) feelings of rivalry that may arise in children due to the preferential treatement disabled siblings appear to receive from parents. A total of 62 youngsters of 8-14 years of age and their mothers were interviewed. Half of the youths had a younger mentally retarded sibling; and half had a younger nondisabled sibling. Findings suggest  that children's lives are altered in a number of important ways when they grow up with disabled siblings. Data suggest a picture of resilience rather than of vulnerablity. Although some children may be troubled about extra family responsibilities, sibling conflict, or feelings of jealousy and rivalry, these factors generally did not account for substantial variability in children's adjustment.

The basic goal of the project was to enable preservice teachers to view the teaching of reading, movement education, and music as a holistic process which encompasses aspects of the school day and emphasizes the development of content understanding, teaching skills, and positive attitudes toward each subject. Affective and cognitive goals were determined. Cognitive goals were divided by subject area, and included skills and content. The curriculum of the reading methods class was based on four structures: (1) one-to-one diagnosis and teaching; (2) small group direct instruction; (3) total group instruction and integration of the disciplines; and (4)  total group and individualized instruction. For the movement curriculum, teachers were taught that competent teaching in movement education required the development and mastery of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective understandings. The music curriculum involved the acquisition of music skills, analysis and observation of teaching and learning events, and peer teaching skill development and application. A sample lesson of the integration of the three subject areas is described. (RJC)",

        "description":"Types of utterances used by mothers in two different situations with children 13- to 14.5 months old were compared. A set of toys was provided for free play. The toys were also represented in a picture book. Mothers' utterances were classified into five categories: description, attention focus, language elicitation, label, and behavior regulation. Mothers used proportionally more directives in the free play setting, and more focus and label utterances in the book setting. Mothers' use of a category in one setting did not predict its use in the other. Frequent sequences of utterance types used to engage attention, interact, and change topics appeared in both settings. In book reading, sequences tended to be directed toward labeling and describing, whereas in free play, sequences  were frequently organized around a child's action. The two situations differed in the strategies mothers used to maintain task-appropriate behavior. It is concluded that maternal speech may demonstrate ways in which language can be used to encode situation-specific goals and shifts in joint attention. Related materials are appended. (Author/RH)",

Participants included 109 families who completed survey questionnaires at the beginning and end of the school year. The questionnaire included four scales measuring levels of family practices in four areas: Holiday Celebration, Home Content, Keeping Kashrut, and Affiliation. Results indicated a significant change in Holiday Celebration and Home Content. The most significant increase was in the celebration of Sabbath, which was observed every week in the centers. No changes were observed in Keeping Kashrut and Affiliation. It was concluded  that an early childhood Jewish program which emphasized parent involvement was associated with a significant positive change in the families' Jewish practice. Participating families increased holiday celebrations and acquired more Jewish objects after they enrolled a child in a Jewish Early Childhood Center. (Author/RH)",

The program was designed to allow participants the opportunity to succeed on the job and to continue to receive help in paying for child care. Information on the demographics of recipients and their families, length of training programs, wages, work schedules, and other variables was obtained. Findings indicated that the most successful clients tended to have participated in longer training programs, have fewer but younger children, be married, have worked more than 30 hours per week, and have earned more than $4.00 per hour. Those least successful were more  likely to have received Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) when beginning their training programs. It was concluded that: (1) the program should be continued and studied further; (2) PIC participants with children needed careful counseling about wages and work schedules before accepting their first position after a training program; (3) intense case management of clients receiving AFDC would help enhance success rates; (4) the relationship between length of training programs and ultimate self-sufficiency warranted further examination; and (5) the study had particular significance for welfare reform.

Participation in Head Start was compared to other forms of preschool experience and no preschool experience for disadvantaged children in two American cities in 1969-1970. Both preprogram background and cognitive differences were controlled in a covariance analysis design that used dependent measures in the cognitive, verbal, and social domains. Findings indicated that children who attended Head Start maintained educationally substantive gains in general cognitive and analytic ability, especially when compared to children without preschool experience. These effects were not as large as those found immediately after the Head Start intervention.  Findings suggest an effect of preschool, rather than of Head Start per se. Initial findings of greater effectiveness of Head Start for children of below-average initial ability were reduced but not reversed. It is concluded that the diminuition of effects over time, especially for low-ability children, may reflect differences in quality of subsequent schooling or home environment.

        "description":"Available scores from the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and Metropolitan Achievement Test-6 tests, administered between 1984 and 1988 to 88 students enrolled in a Montessori magnet program in the Houston Independent School District, were statistically analyzed. The t test for independent samples was computed to determine if minority students' scores differed significantly from test norms and district means. The study also computed analysis of variance in an effort to identify significant internal variance. Students in the subject population consisted of three cohorts: student were 31 percent Black, 26 percent Hispanic, and 39 percent White. Score analysis indicated that test performance of minority students in the Montessori magnet program was significantly higher than either the  test norms or district means. The study concluded that Hispanic and Black students who have been enrolled in a Montessori magnet program for a year or more have impressive academic advantages. The students demonstrated mastery of subject material, measured by standardized tests, in all subtest areas. However, while the Montessori program has reduced deficiencies in minority achievement, it has not eliminated them. Even after several years in a Montessori program, race-related differences in student performance remain. Over 90 references are cited. (RH)",

A total of 25 adolescent and 25 adult single mothers were videotaped during 4-minute teaching sessions with their 4-month-old infants in their homes. Investigators rated maternal teaching strategies and the affective climate provided by mothers during the teaching task. Mothers also completed questionnaires that included measures of locus of control, child rearing beliefs, perceived influence on child outcomes, and a positive outlook for their child's future. Results suggested that adolescent and adult mothers who felt that their lives were controlled by external factors or who held authoritarian beliefs about parenting performed less well  while teaching their infants than did mothers who held less authoritarian beliefs about parenting. Perceived parental influence on child outcomes correlated positively with teaching interactions in both groups. Regression analyses indicated that belief in chance occurences and perceived parental influence on child outcomes were the best predictors of teaching interactions among adolescents. Authoritarian beliefs about parenting were the best predictor of teaching interactions among adults. (RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to empirically corroborate the hypothesis of Campos and Izard that the organized quality of infant emotion functions as a predominant means of communication during infancy. The study was designed to determine whether 6-month-old infants' facial expressions of emotion &quot;systematically co-occur&quot; with specific behaviors to form coherent affective action configurations. Participants were 50 mother-infant dyads who were videotaped during face-to-face interactions. Infants' facial expressions of emotion were coded using Izard's AFFEX system. Infants' behavior was coded for social engagement, object engagement, signals and solicitations, distress behaviors, and self-comforting. Four affective action configurations were identified. Each was characterized by  particular behaviors in association with a particular facial expression. Configurations were coherently organized and significantly different from each other. These results support Campos and Izard's hypothesis. It is suggested that the affective action configurations convey different messages regarding the infants' emotional states and engagement with people and objects. Furthermore, it is suggested that the use of traditional emotional terms to label these affective action configurations may be misleading and limiting. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Temperament and objective and subjective measures of academic competence were interrelated in order to test two alternative models: (1) a direct effects model stressing intraorganismic, noncontextually mediated links; and (2) a developmental contextual model emphasizing social interactional processes between students and teachers. Data from the Pennsylvania Early Adolescent Transitions Study were also used in the test. Results of LISREL analyses, both at the end of grade 6 and the end of grade 7, supported the developmental contextual model, and indicated that there were significant paths between second-order temperament factors and teachers' ratings of students' academic competence. In turn, these ratings were related to students' self-rated competence, to grade 6 and 7 grade  point averages, and to grade 6 scores on a standardized achievement test. In sum, individual differences in developmental change occurred by means of person-context relations evoked by a person's characteristics of individuality. Findings are discussed in regard to the possible role of temperament in moderating early adolescent coping. (RH)",

        "description":"This keynote speech discusses the rise of telecommunicated distance education in the United States. Interactive satellite broadcasts for K-12 instruction are now received by more than 1,000 schools in more than 40 states. Similarly, many states are working with two-way interactive television projects, slow-scan television systems, and microcomputer-based teleteaching. While correspondence schools once filled a major void for small rural schools, student motivation suffered because of the lack of &quot;real time&quot; interaction. Current distance education holds the educational promise of curriculum equity for students in isolated settings. Schools that lack enough trained teachers should examine distance education alternatives. The selection of media is important and depends upon the  goals and needs of the local school. Small school cooperatives, made up of two to five schools, can be connected by means of audio, video, or computer linkages. There are advantages and disadvantages to every technology. Strengths and weaknesses are offered for each of three systems: satellite TV teaching, audiographic teleteaching (microcomputer networks), and two-way TV instruction. Issues to be examined before a system is selected include: (1) transferring materials between schools; (2) classroom management; (3) levels of interaction; (4) teacher selection and training; (5) extent of course offerings; (6) scheduling; (7) class size; and (8) local control. This document also includes a list of eight successful distance education practices, ranging from careful planning to a reminder  that course content, not the medium, is most important to the overall success of a program.

The opening statement by Representative Bob Whittaker (Kansas) notes that the aging of America creates a more difficult time for the rural elderly than their urban neighbors. Distance and low population density magnify the difficulties of inadequate medical care, low retirement income, and lack of transportation. Speakers discuss a volunteer network of services for the elderly, shared housing alternatives, types of group therapy, senior citizens law projects, and home nursing services. One speaker describes good accounting practices for transportation which allow multi-funded systems to meet financial reporting requirements of human service agencies purchasing rides. Problems of  health care and mental health care delivery to the rural elderly are particularly prevalent. Problems include health manpower, support for family practice residency training, the high cost of medical education, the plight of rural hospitals, fee differentials under Medicare, and medical liability issues. A program that enlists the help of school nurses and counselors, public health nurses, and social workers as part time mental health workers in order to provide more manpower without additional budget is described.

Students read both silently and orally in English and German, German being the language used for worship services. History and geography are also considered important subjects, but less important than mathematics and reading.  Sixty-six percent of student time was spent working individually. Students know what work they have to complete and stay on-task with few verbal statements by the teachers. The community is an integral part of these schools, providing building and maintenance, teacher hiring, and school board membership. Community members also visit the schools quite frequently. These schools are differentiated from modern public schools by the cooperative attitude, community involvement, importance of reading, and reflection of community values.

This issue abstracts and reviews the implications of new research dealing with substance abuse among minority youth, specifically Native Americans. The goal is to help bridge the communications gap between researchers, practitioners, and the general population by disseminating research in an accessible manner and providing an introductory overview. The overview of the abstracted documents discusses minority youth as an at-risk population. The research uniformly demonstrates that substance abuse is widely prevalent among Native American adolescents and even younger children. Alcohol is by far the most widely  abused drug among all age groups, with marijuana the next most popular substance for abuse. It is evident that drug prevention programs developed for mainstream youth have had little impact on minorities and that any prevention efforts must overcome several cultural and socioeconomic barriers. Various cultural factors have been studied as being important in increasing the possibility of substance abuse among American Indians. The overview calls for education and intervention programs, suggesting that work be directed toward reducing the number of factors that put Indian youth at risk. The overview is followed by 20 abstracts of published research from 1985 to 1988 arranged alphabetically by author. The document also contains 112 references. (TES)",

This report, the first in a series on rural poverty, describes the characteristics of the rural poor and examines rural-urban differences in poverty. In 1987, the poverty rate was 16.9% in nonmetropolitan areas, compared to 12.5% in metropolitan areas and 18.6% in central cities. Between 1978 and 1987, poverty rates in both nonmetro areas and central cities rose more than 20%, although unemployment rates for the two years were similar. Poverty rates for Blacks in 1987 were 44.1% in nonmetro areas and 33.3% in central cities; poverty rates for Whites and Hispanics did not differ between nonmetro areas and central cities. In nonmetro areas, as in  the rest of the nation, Blacks, families headed by women, young families, and children were most likely to be poor. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the rural poor did not fit common stereotypes. They were White and lived in families containing two parents with at least one worker. Elderly people also comprised a larger share of the nonmetro than of the metro poor. In addition, rural poverty was concentrated regionally. The South contained 53.6% of the U.S. nonmetro poor, virtually all of the Black nonmetro poor, and 188 of 206 &quot;persistently low income counties&quot; in the United States.

        "author":["Trotter, Joe W."],
        "description":"This essay focuses on southern West Virginia between 1915 and 1932 to explore the dynamics of Afro-American work and community life in the Appalachian region. More specifically, it analyzes the rise and expansion of the black coal mining proletariat, the role of black men and women in the process, and the impact of the proletarianization on black economic life in coal mining towns. The emergence of the black coal mining proletariat was an exceedingly complex process. It was deeply rooted in the imperatives of black life in the rural South, as well as the dynamics of industrial capitalism in the coal fields. Coal demands and production increased during and after World War I, leading to a sharp rise in the number of black men entering the mining labor force. Through their Southern  kin and friendship networks, black coal miners played a crucial role in organizing their own migration to the region, facilitating their own entrance into the industrial labor force. The volatile nature of black coal mining employment also required substantial contributions from black women. These included child-rearing, gardening, canning, and small-scale home farming, along with the regular domestic tasks. In 1920, when 19.8% of black women were gainfully employed, only 10.8% of the American-born white women and fewer foreign-born women were so employed. This document quotes numerous primary sources and contains 26 end notes. (TES)",

        "description":"This document reports the oral and written testimony of 14 witnesses who discussed general health and nutrition problems among American Indians and focused on the high incidence of diabetes among North Dakota Indians. Diabetes was relatively rare among American Indians before 1940. Nearly one in three members of The Three Affiliated Tribes aged 40 or older is diabetic, according to a 1986 health report. The Three Affiliated Tribes live on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. Much of the testimony mentioned cultural, physical, and psychological effects caused by rural resettlement of Indian tribes who were displaced by a dam construction project on the Missouri River in the 1950s. Other discussion topics included diabetes, alcoholism, diet, and general nutrition among  the Indians; government and private assistance programs; and the need for new health services on the reservation. During the hearing, testimony was given by Peter Bennett, National Institutes of Health; Dr. James Brosseau, Grand Forks Clinic; Emmarine Chase, tribal elder at Fort Berthold Reservation; Raymond Cross, counsel for The Three Affiliated Tribes; Elsie I. Danks, Extended Food and Nutrition Education Program, Fort Berthold Reservation; Byron L. Dorgan (North Dakota), Mickey Leland (Texas), and Timothy J. Penny (Minnesota), members of the U.S. House of Representatives; Gretchen Chesley Lang, associate professor of cultural anthropology, University of North Dakota; Edward Lone Fight, chairman of the Council of The Three Affiliated Tribes; Sister Anna Rose Ruhland, tribal  nutritionist, Fort Berthhold Reservation; Dr. Terrence Sloan, director of Aberdeen Area Indian Health Services (South Dakota); Alonzo Spang, Bureau of Indian Affairs (Fort Berthold Agency); and Dr. Herbert J.

        "author":["Sher, Jonathan P."],
        "description":"This paper discusses the question of standardization and educational equity among rural school systems and offers three &quot;fundamental challenges&quot; for educators. The first challenge is to take seriously the power of education and to resist the temptation to reduce expectations placed on education and educators. The power of education is illustrated through the comparison to a knife, which can be used for good or evil. The second challenge is for educators to resist the trivialization of educational power. Classroom methods and labels such as &quot;at-risk students&quot; tend to blame students for what are societal or system failures. A sense of &quot;condemned future&quot; is created, causing students, teachers, and parents to become disengaged or drop out of the educational process. The  responsibility for &quot;at-risk&quot; students should be placed on educators, who might better see the dropout problem as &quot;a massive, unorganized and, as yet, undeclared boycott of public education.&quot; Traditional solutions to the dropout problem (advertising, inschool suspensions, and dropout prevention counselors) do not respond to the causes. The third challenge is to make use of current opportunities to reverse the decline of rural education. A core of good people, an opportune moment in history, and a body of new ideas help to make the horizon brighter. Challenging projects are being undertaken across the country. This paper concludes by telling educators that the power of education and the power for educational change is in their hands. (TES)",

        "author":["Raymond, Frank B., III"],
        "description":"This paper describes how a school of social work in a predominantly rural state made successful use of interactive closed circuit television (ICCT) to train and offer continuing education to rural social workers. While the overall rate of rural population growth has declined in recent years, social problems in these areas have increased, a situation resulting in the need for more social services and more trained social work practitioners. Other reasons for the increased need for social work training include: (1) the growth of job opportunities in social work and related fields; (2) the dramatic increase in the number of states that regulate social work practice; (3) the influence of accrediting bodies; and (4) the desire by agencies for better trained social workers. While there  has been a proliferation of part-time study programs in graduate social work education, many of them remain inaccessible to rural students. The ICCT program at the College of Social Work at the University of South Carolina provides education and training in rural areas. The system links the main campus with over 20 &quot;classrooms&quot; in university branches and technical schools throughout the state and has helped more than 200 students from rural areas to receive their masters degrees. It also provides continuing education opportunities, such as teleconferencing, for human services workers in the field. This paper concludes that it is incumbent upon social work educators to utilize state-of-the-art technology to meet the needs of its constituents. Contains 10 references. (TES)",

        "author":["Hobbs, Daryl"],
        "description":"This paper examines and questions popular ideas about education and its relationship to the economic well-being of individuals, communities, regions, and the nation. It suggests that the criteria used to develop economic and educational strategies have produced mixed results at best, especially in rural areas. Since family income is related to student performance and the rural poverty rate is 50% higher than in urban areas, rural economic development should be as much or more a part of school improvement than strategies (e.g., consolidation) that are confined to the school level. Despite some limited successes of rural industrialization strategies, rural poverty, and Appalachian poverty in particular, has not improved. Educational reform should take into consideration the  profound economic and social changes brought on by industrialization and new technologies. Traditional policy constraints on rural schools should be removed to encourage innovations that better link them with their surrounding communities. Other factors to be taken into consideration for rural education reforms include school size, experiential learning, accountability, improving rural schools as community resources, and organizational and curriculum change. Seventeen policy recommendations are listed. They include: making relevant data more available to policymakers; creating financial incentives for collaborative programs and networks; reviewing regulations to encourage greater educational entrepreneurship; and creating finance formulas that are more sensitive to rural schools. This  paper calls for policy innovation, suggesting conventional development will bring continued erosion of rural education and hasten the exodus of its best students. (TES)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on data concerning the characteristics, attitudes, and school experiences of rural dropouts. The discussion, which draws largely upon the High School and Beyond database, considers two primary concerns. The first deals with differences between rural dropouts and their rural counterparts who stayed in school. Areas of inquiry include: gender, grades, test scores, self-concept, locus of control, life values, and students' ratings of school conditions. The second consideration encompasses the differences between rural and urban dropouts relative to the same criteria. In general, results of the study were consistent with other analyses revealing differences in attitudes between dropouts and graduates. Although no gender-related differences were found, differences  in socioeconomic status were pronounced. Rural dropouts rated their schools lower on all items than rural stayers, although both groups gave low ratings to effectiveness and fairness of discipline. The figures indicate that dropouts' lower self-esteem may be partially a result of negative school experiences rather than personality traits. Rural dropouts were more likely than urban dropouts to report homemaking or looking for work as activities after dropping out. Rural dropouts were also more likely to report getting a job or not getting along with teachers as the cause for dropping out. More than urban students, rural dropouts were more likely to be American Indian or white and more often reported leaving school to get married. Urban dropouts, who were more likely to be black or  Hispanic, more often reported leaving school to support families or because friends were dropping out. This document recommends further research.

General criteria used to evaluate each database's strengths and weaknesses include standardization, reliability, completeness, consistency, utility, and accessibility and documentation. Five federal agencies maintain seven migrant-related computerized databases, but nonstandardized data collection, inconsistent definitions, and duplicated counts tend to negate their potential utility for in-depth nationwide analysis of the Migrant Education Program. Other national information sources include nine federal surveys with data on seasonal farmworkers as  a group, and nine nonprofit organizations that deal with migrant issues. Four local and 28 state-level databases in 17 states contain data on migrant students; 24 of these maintain records on individuals. However, it would be difficult to link this information to produce meaningful national figures. A review of 11 research studies on migrant workers, students, and service programs focuses on the adequacy of the data and databases used, and points out the inadequacy of any single information source, the difficulties of using several sources, and the resulting inconsistency among research findings.

Findings include: (1) 51% of currently migrant students were enrolled in only one MEP school during the period; 27% were enrolled twice; (2) recruitment and enrollment of currently migrant students were least successful in Eastern Stream states; (3) only 46% of all enrolled eligible children received services funded by MEP; (4) MSRTS achievement test data were not nationally representative of MEP  participants and could not be used for a valid national study of MEP student achievement; and (5) frequent retesting of migrant children could have produced test wiseness and invalid test scores. Overall, the quality of the data was unexpectedly high, and limitations on analysis arose primarily from missing data due to the voluntary nature of data entry. Existing MSRTS data can be used in analyses that answer educational policy questions about: (1) the population receiving services and the services received; (2) differences in the characteristics and needs of formerly versus currently migrant students; and (3) the relative effectiveness of varying service delivery methods. The gap reduction model and a formative analysis using multiple regression are appropriate models for analysis of  MSRTS data. This report contains 46 tables, a sample MSRTS student record, and recommendations for improving MSRTS for research purposes. (SV)",

        "description":"This manual was written as a guide for state migrant education recruiters who need to be familiar with the nature of seasonal and temporary work performed by Louisiana's migrating agricultural workers and fishing industry laborers. It is intended to teach recruiters about the agricultural and fishing activities necessary for raising and harvesting crops or fish and the time of the year in which they generally occur. The main purpose of this guide is to provide each migrant education recruiter with a precise and accurate vocabulary of work activities, for use in interviewing workers, fishers, growers, and processors. This should increase the recruiter's ability to determine migrant education program eligibility and strengthen documentation for the program. The agriculture section  of the book includes information on 23 different crops, including cotton, rice, pecans, soybeans, sugar cane, hay, fruits, Louisiana citrus, strawberries, blueberries, crawfish, trees, fish farms, livestock, turf grass, nursery crops, vegetables, poultry, Christmas trees, tobacco, peaches, grain crops, and dairy products. The fishing section includes information on fish and shellfish. (TES)",

The performance of 103 students on four examinations during a semester constituted the dependent variable. A two-by-two factorial design with two groups for gender and two groups for each of the four self-report variables was used. The results of analysis of variance failed to reveal a difference between men and women and between high and low groups on mathematics competency, computer competency, and attitudes toward statistics. A significant difference was found in test performance between high and low grade point average groups and a  significant interaction was found between gender and mathematics competency. The interaction showed that women had lower scores than men when both reported having less mathematics competency. Findings suggest that the role of person variables depends, in part, on the operational definition that investigators use. (Author/YP)",

The first section of this paper describes the changes in the structure and content of the science curriculum of the seminary from about 1868. The second part presents a brief intellectual biography of Cornelia Clapp to suggest something of the changes in the attitudes and  consciousness of faculty engaged in the transformation of the curriculum.

Students assume the role of an industrial engineering technician determining the amount of time allowed and operator pay for completing an operation on a production line. A deck of playing cards, a clipboard, a stopwatch, and graph paper are needed. The term &quot;piece rate,&quot; related with other pay methods is explained, using an example. The method to set the piece rate is described: (1) breaking the operation into parts; (2) setting quality standards; (3) developing workplace layout; (4) developing methods; (5) determining time allowed; (6) considering other costs; and (7) assembling this information. Other uses,  such as time and motion studies, and equipment justification are discussed. Figures of the stopwatch, time-study board, worksheets, seven exercises, and three projects are presented. Benchmark for hand movement, benchmark for walking, setting a base rate, and manufacturing company forms are provided in the appendices. (YP)",

The purpose of this research is to find the effect of the activities on the learner's locus of control and attitude toward science at grades 7 through 10. A multivariate analysis of covariance was carried out using pretest scores. Science activities emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships increased the internal locus of control of students in the eighth grade. However, at the ninth grade level the opposite occurred. Two possible reasons for the contrary results were discussed. There were significant treatment effects on the attitudes towards the social implications of science, normality of scientists, and inquiry.  Implications for science activity and further research were suggested. Activities used in the project by grade are listed in the appendix. (YP)",

        "description":"Methods for meta-analysis have evolved dramatically since Gene Glass first proposed the term in 1976. Since that time statistical and nonstatistical aspects of methodology for meta-analysis have been developing at a steady pace. This guide is an attempt to provide a practical introduction to rigorous procedures in the meta-analysis of social science research. It approaches the use of modern statistical methods in meta-analysis from the perspective of a potential user. The treatment is limited to meta-analysis of studies of between-group comparisons using the standardized mean difference as an index of effect magnitude. This guide is organized according to a variant of Cooper's stages of the research review process: (1) problem formulation; (2) data collection and data evaluation,  data analysis and interpretation; and (3) presentation of results. Although each stage is discussed, the greatest emphasis is placed on the stage of data analysis and interpretation. Examples from a synthesis of research on the effects of science curricula are used throughout for illustration. Because this book is intended to be a practical guide, the references are provided primarily to exemplify issues or techniques rather than to provide theoretical discussions or derivations. (CW)",

As a field of study science education deals with the induction of the next generation of scientists into scientific ways of thinking and working and with the wider dissemination of a &quot;public understanding of science&quot; among the population at large, and with the issues which these concerns raise. Social studies of science (or science studies) is the collective term for a group of disciplinary interests in science, notably sociology, history and philosophy of science. Several studies of  science have centered on the institutions of science, the practices of scientists and the nature of scientific knowledge. This book was written to try to bridge the gap between the interests of these two groups. Topics discussed include: (1) science instruction; (2) experimentation; (3) constructivism; (4) reading and writing about science; and (5) modifying the image of science for children. (CW)",

Many research results suggest that students should learn mathematics by experience. Students' misconceptions may be formed because of the sudden shift from arithmetic to algebra. Up to the eighth grade, mathematical content has been heavily repeated. For more of the active doing of mathematics, four common activities (abstracting, inventing, proving, and applying) and four processes (generalizing, conjecturing, convincing, and specializing) are recommended. The curriculum standards developed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the curriculum framework developed by the National Academy of Sciences, some projects sponsored by the National Science  Foundation, the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project, and other projects are described. Constraints against curricular change are listed and teacher collaboration is emphasized as accessary to obtain change in mathematics curriculum. Six schools selected as exemplary programs are introduced. Addresses of five mathematics curriculum projects and project directors involved in the Urban Mathematics Collaborative project are listed.

Publications occasionally print accounts of successful science fairs, but these articles are usually based on opinions rather than on research. The purpose of this study is to report desirable characteristics of a school science fair according to available research. The characteristics include: (1) type of project to be entered in the fair; (2) determination of students who should participate; (3) relative merits of competitive or noncompetitive fairs; (4) value of working individually or in groups; (5) motivators offered; and (6) amount of work expected to be done outside of the classroom. The document includes  the summaries of 35 articles and a glossary. Several recommendations are stated: students should do experimental projects; students of all grade levels should participate; competition with clear goals can be an effective motivator in science fairs; the most effective structures include cooperative student projects; and better quality projects can be expected when children work on them outside of the classroom.

        "description":"This paper describes a model of the influence of personal and environmental factors on students' valuing of two deep-processing strategies for studying expository texts. In the model, task orientation (a form of intrinsic motivation in which learning and understanding are the major goals) interacts with perceptions of the teacher's goals to influence both subsequent task orientation and strategy-value beliefs. Questionnaire data from 281 high school science students, collected near the beginning and end of a school year, were used to test the model. The questionnaires included measures of two additional variables thought by other theorists to influence study strategy use: perceived ability and attitude toward science. Individual differences in the initial level of students' task  orientation appear to exert a powerful influence, both on later motivation and on their belief in the value of deep-processing strategies. Perceptions that their teacher wanted them to think independently as well as thoroughly master the material appear to positively influence both students' task orientation and their strategy-value beliefs over the course of a school year. Neither perceived ability nor attitude toward science added significantly to the model's explanatory power. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, with an emphasis on the potential for teachers to affect student goals and strategies for studying science. (Author)",

It transforms the mission from a focus on machines, electronics, and nameless bits of data to a human adventure. By monitoring the experiment data stream, talking to the crew, and watching live television from orbit, scientists on the ground virtually work side by side with their colleagues in space. This close interaction enables scientists on the ground or in space to respond to experiment results as they happen, adjust the experiment if appropriate, and maximize the scientific return. Manned space  science is a very special bridge that transports the scientist on the ground to space in a way not possible by other research methods. This book describes living and working conditions on the Spacelab and the Space Shuttle as well as experiments related to: (1) materials science; (2) solar physics; (3) space plasma physics; (4) atmospheric science; (5) earth observation; (6) astronomy and astrophysics; and (7) new technologies.

        "description":"The recent increase in enrollments in college remedial mathematics courses makes clear the need for the development of pedagogy and curriculum which is tailored to this relatively new class of service courses. Besides the need for courses which teach basic skills in arithmentic, general mathematics, and elementary and intermediate algebra, a growing concern for better thinking skills among college students has added an important new dimension to the teaching of remedial mathematics. The Basic Math Program of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has instituted two new courses for empowering math-weak students to think critically and quantitively. Two fundamental perspectives guide the design of the program: (1) the constructivist epistemology of Piaget advocates the active  role of the learner who must invent concepts rather than passively receive &quot;knowledge transmissions&quot; from authorities; and (2) recent studies on the role of metacognition demonstrate the importance of reflecting on one's thought processes to facilitate learning and generally to increase self-awareness and self-confidence. Students spend the majority of class-time solving problems in pairs and in small groups. Teachers interact with their students more as coaches and clinical interviewers than as lecturers. Diversity, debate, controversy, and consensus replace authority in the quest for understanding in mathematics. (Author)",

It has provided: (1) descriptive information about student strengths and weaknesses in basic and higher order skills; (2) data comparing groups of students by race and ethnicity, gender, type of community, and region; (3) trend data reflecting the ups and downs of performance over the years; and (4) correlations between achievement and some student experience variables. It has  been recommended that this assessment be expanded by NAEP to provide state-by-state comparisons. The purpose of the National Assessment Planing Project is to: (1) provide a general design for national assessment; (2) make recommendations which address state and local questions; and (3) describe the mathematical abilities and content topics on the 1990 National Assessment in Mathematics.

Jaffree, in which the Court struck down an Alabama statute that provided for a daily period of silence in all public schools for meditation or silent prayer. The individuals who participated in these hearings debated several issues, including: (1) what were Thomas Jefferson's positions on the role of religion in the United States and prayer in school? (2) does freedom of speech include the right to pray  in school? (3) would allowing silent prayer or reflection in the school be seen as encouraging religion by providing time for silent prayer or as protecting students from the encouragement of religion by allowing them the option to engage in silent reflection (or non-prayer)? (4) are some &quot;moments of silence&quot; statutes constitutional, while others are not? and (5) what controls on implementation can be guaranteed so that teachers do not go beyond the letter of the proposed legislation?

Approximately 200 key policy makers in the United States who provide leadership in citizenship education and character development at the K-12 levels of schooling were invited to attend. Presented in this document are: the symposium agenda; a list of 23 principles developed by participants for advancing civic virtues and character  development among youth; a list of the participants; a bibliography of 102 readings recommended by the invitees; and copies of 19 handouts provided by the symposium presenters which explain the various programs and goals of their respective institutions.

An initial section called &quot;Points to Ponder&quot; raises questions as to why U.S. educators do things the way they do and what they might conclude about U.S. education through participation in international exchange. The next section, &quot;Common Themes,&quot; points out that Australian and U.S. educators share mutual interests, pursue similar goals, and face similar obstacles. However, vast differences in political structure, practice, and behavior limit true understanding and make it difficult to implement in one  country what appears to work well in another. The section called &quot;Shared Visions&quot; delineates three broad agenda items for education that conference participants agreed each country must find its own ways and means of addressing. Quotes from various participants are included under the heading, &quot;What Did We Learn about Ourselves?&quot; and this is followed by &quot;Afterthoughts from an American Delegate,&quot; which contains observations of one U.S. delegate who remained after the conference to visit public schools and a university. An evaluation of the U.S. delegates performance is contained in a concluding section called &quot;Nature of Meetings.&quot; Ten supplemental materials of interest follow the report.

The statistics relate to economic development and the changes it is bringing about in the world. Sometimes called indicators, the statistics are measures of social and economic conditions in industrial and in developing countries. The guide is intended for use with: (1) a set of six full-color pictures of people in developing countries involved in activities that will help improve the quality of their lives; and (2) a full-color poster map of the world showing related life expectancy indicators. The basic concepts covered by the materials postulate that: (1) life expectancy is generally higher in  industrial countries than in developing countries; (2) there is a higher rate of infant and child mortality in developing nations; (3) as living conditions improve, those mortality rates decline; and (4) progress in improving living conditions and lowering these mortality rates varies widely throughout the developing areas of the world. As a result of using this poster kit, students should be able to read and interpret data, analyze and synthesize information on these topic areas, and develop an understanding of the relationships involved in development, mortality rates, and life expectancy. Vocabulary exercises, photograph exercises, and data table exercises are included in the guide. An achievement test with multiple choice, vocabulary matching, and essay questions is also included and  may be used to evaluate students' understanding of the concepts developed in the kit. (PPB)",

Current research supports models that would merge remedial and regular education and provide all students with broad curriculum access and the opportunity to receive instruction that is adaptive to their needs. Guidelines for addressing remediation in social studies can be generated from a review of current research. There is a clear need for a better understanding of aspects of student success and failure from psychological as well as sociological and anthropological points of view. Attention should shift from concern about the deficits of students to concern about the quality of the pupils' learning environment. This would cause remediation efforts to become part of a broad  program of adaptive education for all students. Also, the importance of the context and processes of schooling would join the issue of cognitive processes in discussions of appropriate curriculum and instructional strategies to be used in teaching social studies. Increased collaboration among special needs teachers and subject area teachers to provide appropriate levels and types of instruction for all students seems to be the most appropriate path for the future.

First, most students are only passive recipients of the information made available to them; second, they seldom appreciate the relevance of this information to their own lives. The primary objective of the project described in this paper is to involve students actively in research while learning course content by having students define and apply major social concepts, use traditional and alternative data sources, and learn computer data analysis skills. Through the completion of four lessons covering the major stages of research, students learn about the source of the facts presented during the course. A field test of the lessons was carried out on one class during the two semesters in  1987. Students (N=44-51) evaluated the utility, difficulty, and contribution to learning for each lesson. The highest marks by students were given for the lessons' introduction to and experience with research skills. The majority rated the lessons' tasks as unrelated to understanding the rest of the course content; while at the same time, they said that the lessons would contribute to learning and help understanding in other courses. The lessons provided students in introductory sociology courses with insight into the research process behind the social facts, contributed to more analytical skills, and increased comprehension of the social structure's impact upon their lives. A 13-item bibliography, 4 tables, and an appendix describing the lessons and supportive materials are included.  (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The character of art criticism, both how it naturally occurs and how it is academically constructed, is reflective of social and aesthetic value orientations--much as the art object itself has been found to be a clue to the values of the society in which it is practiced, used, and appreciated. The belief that the art object possesses characteristics and meanings separate from its sociocultural context, and separate from how it has been interpreted in various times and spaces, has resulted in assumptions of universalism that have served to legitimize certain types of art and to denigrate others. There is a danger that art criticism could become a specific procedure of analysis by which it is believed a pansocial meaning and evaluation of art can be achieved. Future planning for  art criticism instruction should attend to three things: (1) a variety of academic art criticism formats should be developed and instructionally implemented according to the needs, abilities, and interests of teachers and students; (2) vernacular, naturally occurring art criticism needs to be allowed expression within the classroom setting; and (3) the act of art criticism itself, its origins and the use of particular types, should be examined for its taken-for-granted assumptions and for its ability to illuminate some aspects of art and to obscure others. Art criticism, no less than other aspects of art instruction, presents occasions for elaborated artistic understanding as well as a critical consciousness of the origins, range, and possible consequences of instructional choices.

        "description":"History teachers should be less concerned with having students try to re-experience the past and more concerned with teaching them how to learn from the study of it. Keeping this in mind, teachers should integrate more critical film and television analysis into their history classes, but not in place of reading or at the expense of traditional approaches. Teachers must show students how to engage, rather than suspend, their critical faculties when the projector or television monitor is turned on. The first major section of this book, &quot;Analyzing a Moving Image as a Historical Document,&quot; discusses the two stages in the analysis of a moving image document: (1) a general analysis of content, production, and reception; and (2) the study of the moving image document as a representation  of history, as evidence for social and cultural history, as evidence for historical fact, or as evidence for the history of film and television. Strategies for the classroom are also discussed. The second major section, &quot;Visual Language,&quot; is an introduction to visual language meant to serve as a general and selective guide for history teachers new to the critical use of moving-image media in the classroom. Discussions of various aspects of film history and film techniques help to illustrate the possible use of films and television as historical documents and show how film history is a manifestation of the same socio-cultural forces that shape the larger history of society.

The translation of the 23rd edition (1987) of the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) into a German version, known as the Wirtschalfliche Bildung Test (WBT), has enabled that research process to begin. The TEL was adapted for German-speaking students and the economic terms were translated with the goal of maintaining the subjective difficulty of the examination. Problems with intercultural differences caused several questions to be modified. Thirty-one experts at eight German-speaking universities, when asked to judge how well each question in the WBT would measure economic literacy,  felt that the test does measure economic literacy, but more than half of them felt that essential aspects of economic literacy were not tested. Testing shows that just as the TEL discriminates between groups of students with different educational backgrounds in economics so does the WBT. A list of six references is included. (PPB)",

Of those students who passed these courses with a C grade or better (N=5,974), frequency distributions by sex were made. It was found that the distribution of male/female registered as well as male/female passed was approximately 50 percent. Also, females seemed to do better than males in the upper level science courses. An unusually high dropout rate of students who registered for these courses was uncovered, indicating a possible problem with students selecting science courses without adequate preparation. This drop out rate did not affect the male/female ratio regarding passing the course with a C grade or better.  Several recommendations are made: (1) that the college maintain programs to keep the enrollments of female science students at current levels; (2) that some form of program be established to allow female science students to interact with female scientists; and (3) that the college study the reason for the high dropout rate of students in the sciences.

Decision makers may be overly influenced by significant personally-experienced events that loom so large in their eyes that details and related relevant information may pale in comparison. Deficiencies in content or logic may ultimately not matter in the quality or political efficacy of a lesson, but need to be assessed along with the context and effect of the lesson to establish a complete assessment of that lesson and the role the lesson played in the decision making process. Learning can be said to have taken place with regard to examination of a historically based lesson if that experience leads to change or altered policies. This  requires that a baseline be established on what relevant policy makers believed about the world prior to the event. Decision makers do not use history all that poorly when the political context and the actual content of lessons are taken into account. Decision makers do pay attention to current context and that context, not the past, heavily influences the uses of the past. The evidence for the ways to look at lessons from the past are largely drawn from the case of Pearl Harbor and its influence on U.S. post-war defense policy. A list of 28 references is included.

          "Schafer, William D."],
        "description":"A review of the literature on the transfer of preservice teacher training to the classroom suggests that several definitive factors enhance transfer. A social studies methods course was developed with these factors in mind, and included directed reading activities (DRA) with a text, controversial topic discussion, and inquiry. During the academic year 1983-1984, thirty-two student teachers chose one strategy for observation. This study was designed to determine the extent to which the training for those three teacher competencies transferred from the methods class to student teaching. The DRA group (n=9, mean grade point average [GPA] for methods class 2.75 out of a possible 4.0) received the lowest score, 1.4 out of a possible 4.0. The controversial topic discussion group (n=17,  mean GPA 3.09) showed strong discussion features overall, receiving a score of 3.0. The inquiry group (n=6, mean GPA 3.11) performed at a superior level and received a 3.6. DRA lessons require more planning than the others, and this may account for the poor showing there. It is recommended that student teachers be placed with cooperating teachers who have either graduated from the same training institution or are informed as to the major steps of foundational strategies taught in the students teacher's methods courses, thus helping to insure transfer of training. Transfer of training would more likely be promoted if a limited number of foundational strategies were taught in greater depth and subsequently practiced by preservice teachers to the point of overlearning.

        "description":"This issue of &quot;Insights&quot; celebrates North Dakota's centennial. The information and activities it contains were meant for classroom use by teachers from North Dakota during the centennial year, but could provide others with a glimpse of that state's history. A fact sheet on &quot;North Dakota Centennial Dates&quot; gives a brief explanation of the important dates in North Dakota's history that relate to its attainment of statehood. A short history of the state, beginning with the Native Americans in the 1300s and the Spanish and French in the 1500s and 1600s, and ending with statehood in 1889 is contained in an article called &quot;Brief History of North Dakota.&quot; A section headed &quot;100 Years Ago on This Day&quot; is a collection of quotes from the Bismarck (North Dakota) &quot;Tribune&quot; taken from various  dates in 1888 and 1889. An &quot;Issues&quot; section deals with seven problems and challenges that the people of the state may have to face in the next 100 years, ranging from climate to quality of life. Ideas for classroom activities are contained in &quot;Potpourri of Centennial Activities,&quot; and this is followed by an annotated list of 11 projects and activities planned for various parts of the state plus books and curriculum materials that deal with North Dakota's history and Native Americans. Maps and drawings related to the state and its history are contained in a section called &quot;Maps and Things.&quot;&quot;Books about North Dakota&quot; (S. Schmidt) is an annotated bibliography of 13 books by North Dakota authors writing about North Dakota. (JB)",

        "author":["Stone, Frank A."],
        "description":"When authors portray social perspectives and address the themes of growing up and schooling, their books become potential literary sociologies of education. Four case studies are presented that demonstrate how materials of this kind can contribute to intercultural teacher education. Case study 1, &quot;Educational Perspectives in Modern West Indian Novels,&quot; is based on a 1984 study of 16 authors from the Commonwealth Caribbean. Their portrayal of growing up in five English-speaking Caribbean societies presents insights into the educational adjustments emigrants from these societies must make. Case study 2, &quot;Young People Caught Up in a Catastrophe: Experiences of Children and Youth Who Survived the Armenian Genocide of 1915,&quot; is based on a study of six survivors' accounts. It suggests  that if today's youth read such accounts and reflected upon the impact of genocide on people their age, they would be more committed to preventing genocide in the future. Case study 3, &quot;Growing Up Mormon: LDS Educating for a Caring Community as Portrayed in Eight Recent Novels,&quot; summarizes a 1987 study about the moral concerns emphasized in the character formation of youth in Mormon communities by examining the novels of six Mormon authors. Case study 4, &quot;Five Contemporary Novelists' Views of Growing Up Turkish in the 1980s: A Literary Sociology,&quot; is based on works written in Turkish and illustrates the role of translation in literary sociology. A model of intercultural literary sociology processes is presented and the main works utilized in each case study are noted. (JB)",

        "description":"An increasing number of non-statistical software packages are being written as supplementary instructional materials provided free or at low cost for economics principles textbooks. This paper reviews the software programs currently available as ancillary material to several major texts and compares what is available as a group against what should be available if the goal is to use the microcomputer as an effective instructional tool. Much of the current crop of software does not effectively use the computer to instruct the student in a way only the computer can. Instead, much of the software that is written is largely an electronic version of the familiar student workbook. Often this places the student in the role of an electronic page turner. To remedy this shortfall, 14  specific modifications to the software designs are recommended including the following: (1) the software package should consist of menu-driven tutorials and drills such as model simulations, an electronic sketchpad, and a database spreadsheet; (2) the tutorial program should take the form of a dialog, in the Socratic sense; (3) questions in the drill portion of the package should automatically increase in difficulty so the student remains challenged by the questions; and (4) programs should not stand alone, but should be complemented with a brief student guide showing the student how to sign on, manipulate the cursor, and get help, as well as state the explicit instructional objectives for each of the programs in the package.

Program requirements at 44 Christian colleges where PBTS graduates were likely to transfer were compared in order to identify common courses at these institutions which could be used as the core of a new, transferable music program at PBTS. Course catalogs were obtained and required courses were analyzed for all 113 music programs according to kind of college (Bible or liberal arts), accreditation status, degree offered, and specific music major. Music theory, music history, conducting, applied music, and ensemble were required by over 80 percent  of all music programs. The majors church music, music education, performance, and general music accounted for 84 percent of the programs. Hymnology and church music administration were required by over 80 percent of the programs in each of these majors. A music curriculum consisting of required courses in music theory, music history, conducting, ensemble, hymnology, and church music administration was recommended for PBTS, in addition to courses forming three elective concentrations: (1) church music internship and arranging for church music; (2) elementary, secondary, and instrumental methods for music education; and (3) form and analysis and pedagogy for performance.

Selected middle school students in Ohio were involved in a two-year federally-funded program entitled &quot;Learning for Leadership.&quot; The objectives of the program were: (1) to involve students in simulations and debates in established social studies content areas; (2) to involve the parents as part of the educational team; (3) to utilize technology in building student skills (e.g., critical thinking); (4) to provide participating teachers with incentives; and (5) to develop and publish a school-to-school and school-to-business partnership model. The establishment of theoretical perspectives for the project concerning  students' moral development, students' intellectual and ethical development, and Jungian personality types helps to ground the research in a theoretical framework. The following activities were developed: (1) a variety of staff development opportunities; (2) classroom enrichment activities involving regularly scheduled classes and subject materials; (3) pilot projects; and (4) the formation of a community based advisory board to give advice and direction to the project, the importance of which cannot be stressed enough. Models for staff development, curriculum enrichment, and summer school projects are discussed.

This paper uses the definition of peace given by the General Conference of UNESCO at its 18th session, whereby peace is seen as a process, not an event. Education is vital to eliminating prejudice, which is the foundation of injustice, disunity, and war. The four main causes of prejudice/injustice/disunity/war are: (1) self-centeredness, (2) passion, (3) lack of morals, and (4) blind imitation. These lead to five prejudices/injustices/disunities that are the most potent causes of war: (1) racism, (2) sexism, (3) nationalism, (4) classism, and (5) religionism. Education is the primary and most effective means for eliminating prejudice, injustice, and disunity. Teachers must first  recognize and attempt to eliminate their own personal prejudices, then introduce the scientific knowledge that presently exists to support the concept of the oneness and nonviolent nature of humankind. They should attempt to develop the emotional, social, and moral atmosphere necessary for translating this knowledge into practice. Establishing peace in the world is primarily a process of changing how we think about peace which will affect how we feel about peace, and ultimately guide our actions in creating peace.

        "description":"This study explores the usefulness of a creativity construct for arts education. It is hypothesized that an arts orientation is a valid personality construct, that this orientation is correlated with contrasting cognitive skills, and that these skills are manifested in creative behaviors. Sixty-five high school seniors were given the ACT Interest Inventory; tests of logic, insight, divergent and creative thinking; and a modified version of the Creative Behavior Inventory. Data were analyzed for the total group and a subsample of 35 logical thinkers. Results confirm correlation of the arts orientation with five domains of artistic behavior and three cognitive skills (logic, divergent and creative thinking, but these skills only correlated with two domains of artistic behavior  (literature and art). Discussion centers on fundamental implications for arts curricula and methods of instruction. The data point to the possibility of a prerequisite or threshold level of logic necessary for creative thinking. If arts are to be taught as creative activities to students in the general curriculum, it is clear that many students will not possess the prerequisite reasoning skills. It would seem far better for general curriculum arts courses to develop critical thinking and expressive problem solving skills, and for specialized elective courses to develop creative thinking (discipline based art education). Twenty-five references and five tables of study data conclude the document. (Author/PPB)",

        "description":"Studies of elementary school social studies since the late 1970s, largely from an objective-quantitative perspective, have painted a dire picture but have paid little attention to what teachers are actually doing in the classroom. Researchers have found that little instructional time is spent on social studies, that the textbooks on this subject are severely lacking, that teachers seem uncertain about what should be taught, and that students lack enthusiasm for the subject. However, one must be cautious about over generalizing. There is great variability among teachers, and social studies instruction is sometimes excellent. It is likely that surveys underestimate the amount of time devoted to social studies as materials used for language arts, reading, music, and art often  incorporate social studies content and concepts. When considering priorities, without a firm foundation in reading and writing, learning in social studies is impeded, and mathematical skills are essential for functioning in modern society. Therefore attention to reading, writing, and mathematics at the expense of social studies is understandable. More research from an interpretive-qualitative perspective is needed to help construct a more meaningful characterization of what goes on in classrooms, especially what students are thinking and how they are reacting. The ultimate concern must be with student outcomes. A 51-item bibliography is included. (JB)",

Geographic skills were correlated with respondent age, sex, ethnicity, past travel experience, and past geographic education. Students with previous travel experience were expected to score better on the test while geographically bound groups were expected to score lower. A strong correlation exists between travel and geographic skill. Geographic abilities differ according to age, sex, and ethnicity, but these differences  can be attributed to varying degrees of access to travel. (Fourteen tables of data are included.) (Author)",

While the students clearly enjoyed the simulation, there is limited evidence that student learning improved as a result of participation in the simulation.

Since the opening of China, the teaching of English has been a priority in Chinese education. Students not only learn the English language, but also study the cultures and ethnic groups who are native speakers of English. Thus, the English language and English-speaking cultures are simultaneously emphasized in English teacher training. This approach provides a cross-cultural understanding of both language and culture.

The single-page instrument asks students to evaluate contributions the overall course made to their personal enjoyment, critical thinking, and subject knowledge, as well as rate the contributions of 10 course elements such as instructor, text, and classmates. The utility of this approach is shown by data analyses at three levels of evaluation: department, course and instructor. Several pedagogical implications are discussed. (JD)",

        "description":"A two-phase survey, employing two different survey instruments, was sent in January of 1988 to 51 institutions in Illinois engaged in teacher preparation. Each instrument was aimed at gaining information concerning either the extent of, or reaction to, middle-level teacher preparation in Illinois. The first phase was aimed at examining the extent of specific training programs at the middle-level. The second survey instrument targeted reactions to possible middle-level preparation and certification regulation. The data from the study indicate that the desired state of affairs matches closely existing middle-level programs in the state and that teacher education institutions recognize early adolescence as a distinct developmental phase requiring special understanding from  middle-school teachers. This paper treats the results of both surveys independently and discusses the future of teacher preparation and certification at the middle-level in Illinois. Survey forms are appended. (JD)",

Questions examined in the paper include the circumstances under which deception may be acceptable and useful and how deception may function to augment self-direction. The paper takes the position that the most dangerous form of deception is self-deception. This study offers highlights of Nyberg's paper as well as a brief overview of some elements of gestalt philosophy (the basis for the remarks on Nyberg's paper). Conclusions discuss how schools may better serve a democractic society by shifting the curricular emphasis from socialization as the primary goal of instruction to the development of independent, inventive thinkers and doers as  the temporary primary goal of instruction; temporary because eventually a democratic society needs a balance between the socializing and the development of independent thinkers.

Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to gain a more complete picture of the day-to-day life in the professional development schools. In reporting results, both research and school-reform concerns are addressed in an effort to enhance &quot;research conversations&quot; within schools and between schools and universities. In the first part of the paper, the collaborative context within which professional development schools have emerged is considered.  The second part examines some of the findings of a survey of the 1,065 teachers and 85 administrators in the 24 participating schools, focusing on their responses to questions related to teacher efficacy and empowerment; the response rate was 93.6%. Section three presents related evaluative data derived from participant observation in their schools and interviews with staff members. Finally, consideration is given to the implications of the research findings for school-university collaboration. (JD)",

Currently, more than half of the intern placements are in cluser sites, which provide an opportunity for developing school-based support networks for both interns and cooperating teachers. The study sought to determine: (1) interns' levels of stress and satisfaction as they neared the end of their placement; (2) if the internship setting, age of intern, or level of experience of the cooperating teacher had any influence on levels of stress and satisfaction; and (3) if the type of internship placement had any relationship with the development of an effective support  network. The results of the study provide information that is useful on two dimensions. The overall positive response to the internship aspect of the program provides one more piece of information to support the adoption of extended programs to prepare teachers. The overall low levels of job-related stress indicate that the supportive yet challenging climate that can be developed over the year helps practice teachers enter their profession on a positive note.

        "description":"The focus of this paper is the subject matter preparation of teachers: what subject matter preparation entails, where and when it occurs, and with what outcomes. Since research on teachers' learning of subject matter is a relatively new domain of inquiry in teacher education, the literature is scant. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to offer a framework that can contribute to future research in this area. The paper is organized in three parts. To lay a foundation for the argument, the first section examines the concept of subject matter knowledge, for although the claim that teachers must know what they are teaching appears self-evident, agreement does not exist about what is included in the idea of knowing subject matter for teaching. The second section offers a  framework for the sources and outcomes of teachers' subject matter learning. In the third section, this framework is used to consider extant evidence about teachers' subject matter preparation. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues raised in earlier sections that suggest directions for future work on the subject matter preparation of teachers. Over 50 references are included.

        "description":"A description is given of the Regional Partnership Program, a field-responsive, center-specific model established at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) designed to oversee clinical field experiences for student teachers. This cooperative partnership calls for a resident tenure track professor to be placed in a geographic area away from the main campus for the purpose of directing the student teaching program, teaching extension courses and being involved in other activities designed by the university. The model involves six regional districts specifically located across the state in such a fashion as to cause the university to be in touch with all areas of the state. The six regional districts serve as the administrative units for the field program, thus allowing the  decision-making process to be more closely aligned to the activities and needs of the field. All partnerships have been developed to allow for the incorporation of a cadre of educational practitioners who participate in the management of the regional center and advise the university on matters related to the total education program. The center-specific component of the UNI partnership program was designed to encourage creativity and to respond to regional needs. Cadre involvement extends beyond clinical field experience activities and cadre members are involved in a variety of teacher education matters. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes interviews with preservice, novice, and inservice teachers on their recollections of elementary or secondary teachers from their student days who served as either positive or negative role models. The interviewees described events in which they were student participant observers, providing a perspective which captures ideas, behaviors, and contexts of particular teaching acts. The paper looks at the nature of these projections as informants report them in the form of recall of their school experiences. The relationship between these recollections of former teachers and the constructs of teaching the informants appeared to hold are examined. In the analyses of the unconscious mentors, the model teachers are described and a summary is given of the qualities they  demonstrated. The first part of the paper reports the detailed findings on the positive and negative models cited, focusing on the reasons given by the informants for choosing them. Comments are made on the qualities of the model the informants chose to report and some sequences and patterns that appear from the reports. The last section briefly describes the role of self-conceptions of teaching, dealing with why the informants wished to enter teaching. (JD)",

This paper describes the significant features of a minority recruitment/support program, which offers a proactive PPST support system. The program is moving toward becoming comprehensive and relies on vigorous proactive support. This paper describes the salient features of the program: (1) an intensive attempt to identify minority students who require the services of the PPST support system; (2) active recruiting of minority students education programs at community colleges, exceptional high school students; and (3)  diagnostic testing of prospective students. Academic class offerings in reading, mathematics, and writing are described. Classes provide a large number of PSST-like problems and students are tested frequently to assist them in overcoming test anxiety. The outcomes and future modifications of the program are discussed.

The data consist of essay responses written at the beginning and end of the term. The authors were interested in whether and how students' ideas changed over the course of the term, what factors influenced the changes, and whether the responses of students in a classroom participation observation version would differ from those in the nonfield version of the course. The study analyzed data along four dimensions that represent major themes in the course: (1) traditions of teaching; (2) the relationship of teaching and learning; (3) the contexts of  teaching; and (4) the knowledge required of teaching. Besides illustrating changes in students' thinking, the paper also describes goals for student learning and activities that students undertake in the course. (Author/JD)",

These sources were: (1) the full EUOT program with feedback plus workshops; (2) feedback only; and (3) the trainer as post-treatment observer. Over a 15-month period, 20 student teachers participated in full treatment of feedback plus workshop, 7 participated in feedback-only treatment, and 23 served as control. Of the full-treatment group, 7 received one post-treatment observation by the trainer and another by an unknown observer, 6 received post-treatment observations by the trainer only, and 7 by an unknown observer only. The study measured change with 11 variables: 4 teacher-focused, 4 student-focused, and 3  class-focused. The paper concludes the EUOT program can have good application at the preservice level. Of the variables measured, student involvement in interactive teaching was the only one for which full treatment was significantly superior to feedback alone. Full treatment changed the ratio of interactive teaching by the teacher to interactive attending by the students, as opposed to rearranging time use. The findings discuss implications for teacher education and suggest areas of further research. (JD)",

        "description":"Although two-stage testing is not the most efficient form of adaptive testing, it has some advantages. In this paper, linear programming models are given for the construction of two-stage tests. In these models, practical constraints with respect to, among other things, test composition, administration time, and inter-item dependencies play an important role. Research indicates that two-stage tests can be constructed both sequentially and simultaneously. Models based on the maximin model for test construction developed by W. J. van der Linden and E. Boekkooi-Timminga (1989) are formulated for the sequential case, with constraints specified at test and subtest levels. It is assumed that a bank of items calibrated under the item response model is available and that &quot;information&quot; is  used in accordance with G. H. Fischer's information model. The maximin design is used in order to select the items that maximize the information in the test, while the resulting test information function still has the desired shape. The paper concludes that simultaneous test construction has the disadvantage of having a large number of variables; hence, constraints must be considered. (TJH)",

        "description":"The estimation of mean and standard errors of the eigenvalues and category quantifications in generalized non-linear canonical correlation analysis (OVERALS) is discussed. Starting points are the delta method equations. The jackknife and bootstrap methods are compared for providing finite difference approximations to the derivatives. Examining the basic properties of the jackknife method indicates that the vector of profile proportions is perturbed by leaving out single observations. The grid of perturbed values is used to estimate relevant derivatives. Bootstrapping means resampling with replacement from the original sample. Both procedures, bootstrapping and jackknifing, are used to compute pseudo-value means and standard errors for four different data sets: (1) the  characteristics of 36 kinds of marine mammals; (2) data describing the attributes of 47 countries; (3) data from a study of school choice for 520 children leaving elementary school; and (4) a sample of 4,863 secondary students from the Second International Mathematics Study. For the small data sets the jackknife and bootstrap were used; for the larger sets, Monte Carlo versions of both were used. The jackknife method appeared less imprecise than the bootstrap method, and jackknife approximations were less stable for smaller samples. It is concluded that the bootstrap method performed better than did the jackknife method. For large samples, the bootstrap procedure works quite well for computing confidence intervals, and eigenvalues computed from OVERALS seem quite stable. Eight tables  present the values from the four data sets, and four figures illustrate category quantifications for all data sets. (Author/SLD)",

The Program for Research on Operator Control in an Experimental Simulated Setting (PROCESS) is a simulation of a dynamic water-alcohol distillation system that can be used in research on operator training. In particular, PROCESS is designed to conduct research on fault management skills. PROCESS is described in detail, starting from a general model of control tasks; it enables the user to maintain the current status of more or less automatic systems or to change the state of the system. PROCESS is discussed from the perspectives of both the operator and the experimenter. The experimental configuration is then sketched, and ongoing research using PROCESS is  reviewed. Recent research on control behavior for slow responding systems has suggested that training programs develop a set of fault management procedures to enable adequate control of the system. It is argued that, after sufficient practice, fault management procedures are cognitively represented as production rules that can yield quantitative predictors of performance. Information processing task analysis was used to determine the steps that build up fault management procedures. The focus of studies currently being conducted with PROCESS is the optimization of training programs for fault management skills, and the goal is the study of transfer of training. Six figures illustrate the PROCESS model. An appendix describes the equations governing PROCESS. (Author/SLD)",

It is shown that the minimization problem belongs to a certain class of convex programs in optimization theory. A necessary and sufficient condition for a solution to yield the unique global minimum of the least-squares function is derived from a theorem by A. Shapiro (1985).

The method uses quasi-loglinear models for the incomplete subgroup x test score x item 1 x ... x item k contingency table. If the subgroup membership is unknown, the models are the incomplete-latent-class models of S. J. Haberman (1979). The (conditional) Rasch model is formulated as a quasi-loglinear model. The parameters in this model that correspond to the main effects of the item responses are the conditional estimates of the parameters in the Rasch model. Item bias can then be tested by comparing the quasi-loglinear-Rasch model with models that contain parameters for the interaction of item responses and the subgroups. An example uses data from a test taken by 286 Dutch  undergraduates who took a multiplication test using Roman numerals and numbers written out in Dutch. Some of the examinees had received training in multiplying Roman numerals. It was expected that Roman items would be biased, and the procedure confirmed this bias. Five tables present the models and study data. A 55-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)",

Two examples of simultaneous test construction are presented. The construction of two parallel tests is considered, and designs of three tests that should measure best at successive parts of the ability scale are described.

Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, which is a graphical method for splitting a test into parallel test halves, has practical relevance because it maximizes the alpha coefficient as a lower bound of the classical test reliability coefficient. This paper formulates this same problem as a zero-one programming problem, the advantage being that it can be solved by algorithms already existing in computer code. Focus is on giving Gulliksen's method a sound computational basis. How the procedure can be generalized to test splits into components of any length is shown. An empirical illustration of the procedure is provided, which involves the use of the algorithm developed by  A. H. Land and A. Doig (1960), as implemented in the LANDO program.

In this paper, it is applied to sets of variables by using sums within sets. The resulting technique is referred to as OVERALS. It uses the notion of optimal scaling, with transformations that can be multiple or single. The single transformations consist of three types: (1) nominal; (2) ordinal; and (3) numerical. The corresponding OVERALS computer program minimizes a least squares loss function by using an alternating least squares algorithm. Many existing linear and non-linear multivariate analysis techniques are shown to be special cases of OVERALS. Disadvantages of the OVERALS method include the possibility of local minima in some complicated special cases, a lack of  information on the stability of results, and its inability to handle incomplete data matrices. Means of dealing with some of these problems are suggested (i.e., an alternating least squares algorithm to solve the minimization problem). An application of the method to data from an epidemiological survey is provided. A 39-item list of references, three data tables, and 11 graphs are included. (Author/TJH)",

Molenaar (1987) and an iterative estimation procedure are used in a simulation study of Rasch model data mixed with aberrant data. Three kinds of aberrant response behavior are considered: (1) guessing to complete the test; (2) guessing in accordance with the three-parameter logistic model; and (3) responding with different abilities on different subsets of items. The power in detecting such aberrants is evaluated in two cases: when item difficulties are known; and when item difficulties are estimated from the data, including aberrants. The results reveal that, in the latter case, the estimates of the model parameters  are biased and that the power of the index, as a consequence, is reduced. It is shown that, by using an iterative procedure, the recovery of the power of the index to the level obtained by known item difficulties is achieved. Furthermore, depending on the type of aberrance, a considerable reduction of the bias in the model parameters is possible. Finally, it is confirmed that this new index allows detection of aberrant response patterns with better statistical properties than former person fit indices. Three data tables and eight graphs are included. (Author/TJH)",

First, the benefits of using one- or two-sided goodness-of-fit tests of patterns with the model are discussed. Then, the consequences of removing non-fitting patterns from Rasch model data are considered. Finally, an iterative procedure to reduce the bias is presented. This procedure replaces non-fitting patterns by certain patterns sampled according to the model. The effectiveness of this procedure is investigated in a simulation study using Rasch model data mixed with aberrant response data.

        "description":"The Rasch Model and various extensions of this model can be formulated as a quasi loglinear model for the incomplete subgroup x score x item response 1 x ... x item response k contingency table. By comparing various loglinear models, specific deviations of the Rasch model can be tested. Parameter estimates can be computed using programs such as GLIM, ECTA, and MULTIQUAL, but this becomes impractical if the number of items is large. In that case, the tables of observed and expected counts become too large for computer storage. In this paper, a method of parameter estimation is described that does not require the internal representation of all observed and expected counts, but rather uses only the observed and expected sufficient statistics of the parameter estimates, which are the  marginal tables corresponding to the model terms only. The computational problem boils down to computation of the expected sufficient statistics which, in its raw form, amounts to summation of a very large number of expected counts. However, it is shown that, depending on the structure of the model, the number of computations can be reduced considerably by making use of the distributive law. As a result, simpler models may be computed much more efficiently in terms of both storage and processing times. Three data tables are provided. (Author/TJH)",

        "author":["van der Linden, Wim J."],
        "description":"A classical problem in mastery testing is the choice of passing score and test length so that the mastery decisions are optimal. This problem has been addressed several times from a variety of viewpoints. In this paper, the usual indifference zone approach is adopted, with a new criterion for optimizing the passing score. Specifically, manipulation of probabilities of misclassification of masters versus non-masters is not incorporated into the scheme. Rather, explicit parameters are introduced to account for differences in loss between misclassifying a true master and a non-master. It appears that, under the assumption of the binomial error model, this approach yields a linear relationship between the optimal passing score and test length. The means by which different losses for  both decision errors and a known base rate can be incorporated in the procedure are outlined, and the means by which a correction for guessing can be applied are described. Results are related to findings obtained in sequential probability ratio testing for binomial populations and in the latent class approach to mastery testing. (TJH)",

        "description":"A small follow-up study of three male and five female children, who were at risk of school failure and were enrolled in a model developmental Early Learning Center in the Boston (Massachusetts) Public Schools, is described. The focus was on determining whether a standardized achievement measure used to evaluate student academic success/progress accurately reflected the level of mastery attained by the students. Despite their satisfactory performance in reading/language arts and mathematics, most of the students scored below the 40th percentile when tested at the end of the school year on the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT6) in reading and mathematics. The students' second-grade teachers were interviewed to determine their assessment of the students' performance vocabulary,  word-recognition, reading comprehension, and writing skill areas. The students' journals were rated by independent judges, and the first-grade achievement of follow-up students on the school department's reading/language arts and writing curriculum-referenced tests were compared with their first-grade achievement on the MAT6 reading test. The MAT6 did not articulate well with other measures of the students' first-grade reading/language arts skills or their second grade reading/language arts school performance. The use of a single test score to classify children for special educational services, particularly in the early childhood years, is questioned. Discrepancies have arisen between the format for classroom learning at the early childhood level and the format for measuring learning.  Five data tables are included; and interrater reliability coefficients, the student follow-up survey, transcription rules, samples of transcribed texts, and the writing sample evaluation instrument are appended.

        "description":"In self-adapted testing, examinees are allowed to choose the difficulty of each item to be presented immediately before attempting it. Previous research has demonstrated that self-adapted testing leads to better performance than do fixed-order tests and is preferred by examinees. The present study examined the strategies that 29 college students used in selecting items during a self-adapted test. After completing the Test Anxiety Inventory, subjects took the self-adapted test. The test contained 40 items sorted into 8 categories of difficulty based on Rasch model estimates. Three test-taking strategies were identified. Most subjects adopted a flexible strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and harder items following success. Some subjects adopted  a &quot;failure intolerant&quot; strategy in which they generally selected easier items following failure and items of the same difficulty after success. Finally, some subjects adopted a &quot;failure tolerant&quot; strategy in which they chose items of the same difficulty level after failure, but harder items after success. The failure-tolerant strategy was associated with lower estimated ability than were the other two strategies. This finding may reflect the attributions examinees adopting that strategy make and the effort they expend following failures. The results provide general support for the value of continued development of self-adapted testing. (Author/TJH)",

At issue is determining whether a test score serves the particular educational function it was designed to serve (for example, course placement), and whether it does so in an economical way. These determinations are made using an extension of the decision theory methods developed by L. J. Cronbach and G. C. Gleser (1965) and by N. S. Petersen and M. R. Novick (1976) in the context of recent ideas about validation. Methodological issues in quantifying system effectiveness are then examined and illustrated. The discussion covers types of placement selection rules, validating such rules, the plausibility of assumptions underlying M. Kane's (1987)  validation paradigm associated with the use of entrance examination scores (American College Test) combined with high school grades, selection rules based on grade predictions, a decision model for validating placement rules, and determination of the effectiveness of remediation. An example is provided that is based on the American College Test scores, self-reported high school grades, and freshmen English course grades of students at a public university (N=5,609).

This paper deals with a related but hitherto ignored aspect of standard setting, namely, the possibility that Angoff or Nedelsky judges misspecify the probabilities of the borderline student's success on the items because they do not use the psychometric properties of the items consistently. A latent trait method is proposed to estimate such misspecifications, and an index of consistency is defined that can be used for deciding whether standards are set consistently enough for use in practice. Results from an empirical study are presented to illustrate the use of the method in a typical educational situation. The results  indicate that serious errors of specification can be expected and that, on the whole, these will be considerably larger for the Nedelsky than for the Angoff technique.

This paper gives moment estimators for such mixtures and presents results from a Monte Carlo investigation into their statistical properties. The results suggest excellent estimators that can safely be used in most instances. It also indicates how the properties of these estimators relate to those of moment estimators for the case in which both success parameters are unknown.

This is done by using a theory of school learning developed by B. S. Bloom (1976). Next, an attempt is made to define the concept of cues. Cues are a part of the quality of instruction or the quality of teaching, including both information to be imparted and directions for providing for adequate absorption and processing of the information included in the material to be learned. It appears that the events of instruction, as outlined by R. M. Gagne, conform to both the requirements of the definition and can be conceived of as being instructional cues. These events include gaining attention, informing the learner of the objective,  stimulating recall of prerequisite learning, presenting the stimulus material, providing learning guidance, eliciting the performance, providing feedback about performance correctness, assessing the performance, and enhancing retention and transfer. A brief description of particular cues and a brief review of some research findings in this field are presented. (TJH)",

        "description":"Latent class models for mastery testing differ from continuum models in that they do not postulate a latent mastery continuum but conceive mastery and non-mastery as two latent classes, each characterized by different probabilities of success. Several researchers use a simple latent class model that is basically a simultaneous application of the binomial error model to both mastery classes. W. A. Reulecke (1977) presents a version of this model that assumes that non-masters guess blindly, with a probability of success equal to the reciprocal of the number of alternatives. Assuming a loss ratio, these models enable the derivation of an optimal cutting score for separating masters from non-masters. To compute this cutting score, the model parameters must be estimated. J. A. Emrick  and F. N. Adams (1969) suggest a method that is based on the average inter-item correlation but which, due to its assumptions, is only of restricted applicability. The sample applies to the maximum likelihood method in as much as this involves estimation equations that can be solved iteratively. In this paper, the method of moments is used to obtain &quot;quick and easy&quot; estimates. An endpoint that assumes that the parameters can simply be estimated from the tails of the sample distribution is discussed. A Monte Carlo experiment demonstrates that the method of moments yields excellent estimators and beats the endpoint method uniformly. Five data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

These studies point to the importance of &quot;reflection&quot; (evaluation of problem-solving results) for flexible problem solving. This  research suggests that teaching students to analyze what they have done will help them develop flexibility in using a new approach when blocked.

Each student had written one essay on each of two prompts representing two models of discourse. Each essay was read by six readers and judged on a scale of from 1 to 4. No reader read essays from both prompts. Reader agreement rates and interrater reliability coefficients were computed. Extensive analyses were conducted using GENOVA, a generalizability analysis program. Special consideration was given to the universes of generalizability for readers and prompts. One set of artificially unreliable scores was introduced to increase variance due to readers and the reader-times-essay interaction and, thus, lower reliability. Results indicate that the score  reliability of essay tests is multifaceted and can be estimated in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the assessment and the intended use of results. When pass-fail decisions or determinations of absolute skill levels are to be made, indices that take into account the cut point or points are needed. Seven data tables and two graphs are provided.

In addition, the study was designed to determine whether participation in vocational counseling activities through the ASVAB program or through Florida CHOICES/View is related to scores on a measure of career development. Subjects were 1,105 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders from 10 high schools in Florida. They were participants in a larger study involving 9,000 students. Major instruments used included the ASVAB and the Career Development Inventory (CDI). The CDI contains a slightly revised 52-item version of the Career Exploration Survey and other items dealing with students' career intentions  and activities. The CDI was administered in the fall of 1986 and in the late spring of 1987. The ASVAB was administered between the two CDI administrations. Results indicate that: (1) students are not good estimators of their abilities; (2) males and females have different estimation patterns, with females showing more variability in inaccurate estimation; (3) accuracy of estimation is not related to ability level; and (4) underestimation of ability could impede proper career development choices. Twenty-three data tables are included, and sample first- and second-order factor scales of the Career Exploration Inventory (CEI) are appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"J. A. Emrick's (1971) model is a latent class model of mastery testing that can be used to estimate the proportion of masters in a given population. A. Hamerle (1980), in a recent paper on this model, has proposed an estimator for the proportion of masters that is claimed to constitute a maximum likelihood approach. It is indicated that Hamerle is not quite correct in his presentation of Emrick's model and that his estimator is not maximum likelihood. An estimator is provided using the method of moments; this estimator appears to have the same shape as Hamerle's estimator, but should be interpreted differently since it is derived under the correct version of Emrick's model. An attractive property of the method of moments is that it also yields simple estimators for the present  model if the two success parameters are unknown. It appears that these estimators can be used for tests consisting of three or more items. Results of extensive Monte Carlo studies indicate that the estimators possess excellent statistical properties. (Author/TJH)",

Targeted students include those identified as learning disabled and those who have auditory and/or visual memory problems. This report describes the second-year (1987-88) implementation of Project READ. The curriculum, which emphasizes phonics, comprehension, and written expression, is delivered through direct instruction strategies with a focus on multi-sensory activity learning. Teachers receive inservice training in the instructional strategies through weekly classroom demonstrations. A total of 1,279 students were identified for participation in Project READ in 1987-88 (including 524 students in  grades 3 through 5, and 294 students in grades 6 through 8). Third through eighth-grade student achievement growth was measured by fall and spring scores on the Portland Achievement Levels Tests in reading and language usage. Results indicate gains were made in both reading and language usage at grade 5, and language usage gains were also educationally important for grades 7 and 8. There were no important differences in achievement growth for students who were in the project for 2 years; both first- and second-year Project READ students made gains in reading and language usage that were comparable to the mean grade-level gains of the district as a whole. Teacher survey data were also positive. Nine tables and one graph are included.

These items, drawn from the National Opinion Research Center's &quot;General Social Survey,&quot; have been the focus of considerable applied research investigating predictors of attitudes toward abortion. The data constitute a probability sample of non-institutionalized adults in the contiguous United States. The abortion item includes seven possible situations for which the respondent is to choose whether or not an abortion should be legal. Since the survey items bear some of the characteristics of a perfect scale, they are also useful in demonstrating applications of theoretical research aimed at extending  Guttman's model to include response patterns not defined by the original scalogram model. Prior to describing the experimental methodology, three models developed to incorporate non-scale response patterns into the scalogram model are summarized as a contrasting background for the Guttman approach. For each of the 7 years of data analyzed in the study proper, a two-dimensional POSAC-I (Partial Order Scalogram Analysis with Base Coordinates) space fit the data quite well, indicating that the responses of those surveyed do not support the hypothesis of a single order among attitudes toward reasons for legalized abortions. Using this ordinal factor analysis it was possible to determine the structure of the abortion scale items. One table, one figure, and 26 computer-generated scalograms are  provided. (TJH)",

The technique revealed that the relationship between course performance and predictor variables differed for advantaged and disadvantaged students. As was consistent with  previous research, personal academic factors accounted for a significant increase in grade performance, and environmental factors tended to affect disadvantaged students more than others. Analysis of retention rates revealed reading comprehension ability to be the best predictor. The implications of the findings are discussed with reference to institutional interventions.

Two issues are addressed. The first is how analogies are elaborated to sanction new inferences about a novel situation. This issue is adddressed by contextual structure-mapping, a knowledge-intensive adaptation of D. Gentner's structure-mapping theory. This approach presents analogy elaboration as a map-and-analyze cycle, in which two situations are placed in correspondence, followed by problem solving and inference production focused on correspondence inadequacies. The second issue is the evaluation the quality of a proposed analogy and its use for some performance task. A theory of verification-based analogical learning is  presented to address the tenuous nature of analogically inferred concepts, and procedures for increasing confidence in the inferred knowledge are described. Specifically, it relies on analogical inference to hypothesize new theories and simulation of those theories to analyze their validity. It represents a view of analogy as an iterative process of hypothesis formation, testing, and revision. These ideas are illustrated via PHINEAS, a computer program that uses similarity to posit qualitative explanations for time-varying descriptions of physical behaviors. It builds upon existing work in qualitative physics to provide a means with which to describe and reason with theories of the physical world. A 144-item list of references is included. (TJH)",

The SIPP is a longitudinal survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau to measure economic, social, and demographic characteristics of persons, and how these characteristics change over time. The SIPP involves a multi-stage cluster sample of all living quarters, representing all non-institutionalized residents of the United States, aged 15 years and older. Households remain in the sample for about 2.5 years, and are interviewed every 4 months. The data for this analysis were restricted to persons aged 18 to 64 years for  whom data on education had not been imputed. Three different measures of education are used: (1) years of school completed; (2) a series of dummy variables based on the years of school data, representing five groups; and (3) a nine-category variable based on the highest degree completed. Analysis of the data indicates that a new measure of educational attainment, based on the highest degree attained, yields a better earnings-to-education relationship than does the existing measure of years of schooling completed. The improvement in the model appears to apply to the entire adult population; however, the addition of subgroup-specific interaction terms demonstrates the added utility of measuring degrees with respect to gender differences in returns to education.

        "description":"The economic impact of optimal selection using ability tests is far higher than is commonly known. For small organizations, dollar savings from higher productivity can run into millions of dollars a year. This report estimates the potential savings to the Federal Government as an employer as being 15.61 billion dollars per year if tests were given optimal use. If the 4 million placements per year made by the United States Employment Service made optimal use of the General Aptitude Test Battery, the potential increase in work force productivity among the employers who hire through the service would come to 79.36 billion dollars per year. However, this would probably require an increase in Employment Service funding of about 8.75 million dollars per year. Departures from optimal  use of tests can be shown to eliminate as much as 84% of these savings. The principal problem is the use of the low-cutoff method of hiring randomly from all who pass some minimal test level. Optimal use of tests can be shown to provide benefits other than reduced labor costs, including a reduction in special administrative problems, an increase in the number of workers with promotion potential, and increases in the quality as well as the quantity of work. Five tables provide supporting figures. (Author/SLD)",

Partial correlations were used to determine the effect of each variable on GATB validities. There were slightly more significant differences between validities for  all jobs than would be expected by chance. Controlling for age somewhat increased validities. Education showed positive correlations with all nine GATB aptitudes, with the highest correlation for cognitive aptitudes and lower correlations for psychomotor aptitudes. Validities were higher for subjects with more than 12 years of education. When education was controlled for, validities decreased slightly. There were more differences in validities between experience levels than would be expected by chance, but the pattern was not consistent across the nine aptitudes.

The sample consisted of 7,854 black and 15,769 non-minority subjects from 113 Specific Aptitude Test Battery (SATB) validation studies analyzed since 1972. The first approach was to compare average validities weighted by sample size. Eight of nine differences were significant and favored the non-minority sample. The largest difference was 0.05. A second approach use a chi-square method developed in 1979 by J. E. Hunter, F. L. Schmidt, and R. Hunter. Two aptitudes revealed differences significant at the 0.05 level. Cumulative chi-square analyses across all studies showed significant differences at the 0.05 level for four aptitudes. The last two  analyses attempted to correct for sources of Type 1 error present in the primary analysis. One compared job family validities and found significant differences for two of five job families. The second corrected for range restriction and criterion unreliability and found significant differences in 10 of 24 critical ratios. The results tend to mirror those of other researchers. Differences, when found, were small and inconsistently favored non-minorities. Given the various forms of Type 1 error and the methods of data collection, there was little indication that validities differ more than would be expected due to chance. Five tables provide study data. Appendices provide tables of the sample members' job information and the distribution of statistics for blacks and non-minorities.  (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The analyses of J. E. Hunter (1983) were replicated with an expanded data set. The Hunter study, the basis of the Validity Generalization system used by the United States Employment Service, contained 515 General Aptitude Test Battery validation studies. The data set in this study included these and additional studies to bring the data set to 755 studies representing 74,187 individuals. Analyses were conducted for the total sample, the original sample, and the new or additional sample. The beta weights developed by Hunter were compared with the beta weights developed for the total sample. Results indicate that the beta weights developed by Hunter in 1983 and those developed from the total sample yield virtually identical validity coefficients. Consequently, there is no need to  change the beta weights currently being used. A secondary conclusion is that the validities for the additional sample are lower than those for the original sample, particularly for the perceptual or psychomotor aptitudes. There is no easy explanation for the decline in validities, but several suggestions are advanced. Eight tables present study information. An appendix contains tabulated data on the 755 studies that constitute the total sample. (SLD)",

Specifically, the paper demonstrates the steps involved in: (1) conducting sensitivity analyses to determine a statistically best-fitting, yet substantively most meaningful baseline model; (2) testing for partial measurement invariance; (3) testing for the invariance of factor variances and covariances, given partial measurement invariance; and (4) testing for the invariance of test item and subscale reliabilities. These procedures are illustrated with item response data from the Perceived Competence Scale for Children from 129 normal and 132 gifted  students in grade 5 and 113 normal and 117 gifted students in grade 8 from two public school systems in Ottawa (Ontario).

Without intervention on behalf of the disadvantaged, the following results may occur: (1) a dual society with a large uneducated underclass; (2) disruption in higher education; (3) national economic deterioration; and (4) rising costs of public services. The educational plight of the disadvantaged is outlined. Any strategy for improving their situation must begin at the elementary level, and must be dedicated to preparing students for doing high quality work in secondary school. Such a strategy is the Accelerated School, a transitional  elementary school that brings disadvantaged children up to grade level by the completion of the sixth grade. The following aspects of the Accelerated School are discussed: (1) school-based governance; (2) goals; (3) pupil and school assessment; (4) nutrition and health; (5) curriculum; (6) instructional strategies; (7) community resources; (8) parental participation and training; and (9) extended daily session. The major organizational dimensions of change required for transforming schools into accelerated learning institutions are discussed, and steps to assist the transformation are suggested.

A committee on educational equity examined the Commission's past actions and activities relating to educational equity and found no insights into ways the State can achieve equity given the changes in demographics. This lack of insight created a sense of urgency which led to the declaration of policy. The major parts of the declaration are the following: (1) a definition of educational equity which includes quantitative and qualitative dimensions; (2) four reasons that educational equity is a critical issue in the State; (3) the principles  which guide the achievement of educational equity; and (4) eight interrelated roles which the Commission will assume so that educational equity will be integrated within all of its statewide policy and program review and coordinative functions.

The following problems are cited: (1) extremely high dropout rates; (2) high levels of student stress caused by poverty, culture clashes, and the marginal quality of inner city life; (3) the need for Hispanic male students to work in addition to attending school; (4) poorly funded and equipped and overcrowded schools; and (5) underrepresentation  in higher education. Recommendations for NEA policy in the following areas are outlined: (1) students; (2) curriculum and teaching; (3) teacher/school personnel; (4) parents/family/community; (5) employment; (6) collaboration/coalition building; (7) legislation/policy; and (8) leadership training. Lists of site visits and witnesses are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"In order for ethnic identity to develop as a methodologically sound area of psychological research, it is essential to agree on definitions and to develop and validate measures that can be used in common by researchers working with different groups. This report analyzes 62 empirical studies of ethnic identity published in 36 journals since 1972. The following topics are discussed: (1) the assessment of the components of ethnic identity; (2) the structure of ethnic identity; (3) the relationship of ethnic identity to the majority culture; (4) the study of changes in ethnic identity over time and context; and (5) the personal implications of ethnic identity. The following theories appear to form the conceptual bases of about one-third of the studies reviewed: (1) social identity  theory; (2) social field theory; (3) acculturation and assimilation theory; (4) Erikson's ideas on identity development and the impact of social and cultural factors; (5) psychoanalytic identity formation theory; and (6) black identity development theory. Definitions of the following concepts are suggested: (1) ethnic identity; (2) identification; (3) self-identification; (4) ethnicity; (5) ethnic attitudes; (6) ethnic behaviors; and (7) ethnic identity development. Common measurement techniques are discussed in relation to a suggested conceptual model and directions for future research are suggested. Two charts and a list of 94 references are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Restoration of an adequate minimum wage remains a critical ingredient in efforts to provide income security for poor and minority workers. The experience of recent years indicates that work does not provide economic security for many poor, Black, and Hispanic workers. National and minority unemployment rates have dropped during the economic recovery, yet many poor and minority workers continue to encounter economic hardship because their wages have remained low or have fallen. The earnings of many of these workers are at or near minimum wage levels. The dramatic drop in the value of the minimum wage to its lowest level since 1949 has compounded their earnings problems and increased their poverty rates. The Bush Administration offers its own minimum wage proposal as an alternative  to the bill passed by Congress that Bush vetoed. However, the Administration's bill would establish a minimum wage still further below its historic value than the modest Congressional legislation, and would establish a broad-based sub-minimum &quot;training&quot; wage that could reduce the earnings of many adult workers who are already poor or members of minority groups.

This study focuses on a group of successful at-risk minority students in an urban secondary school, and in particular on their student experience, including interactions with school culture, student social groups, and teachers. An ethnographic study was chosen as methodology for the investigation. The site selected was an all black inner city high school in a major southern center. The 35 students studied were participants in a newly-formed college preparatory program. Research findings revealed the strong influence of both informal and formal social groups, for which structures, criteria, and rationales are presented. Classrooms  were dominated by teacher-established rules stated in positive and negative imperatives; hallways were covered with bulletin board maxims in the form of exhortations, adages/slogans, and platitudes. Student responses to teachers were diverse, but tended to center on interpersonal relations and professional competence as bases for good or bad ratings. Research implications suggest that the school's interacting complexities argue for multi-dimensional rather than merely quantitative reform measures and for increased student input in critical school operations. The study includes four figures and a list of 11 references. (AF)",

        "description":"This draft report examines patterns in the allocation and distribution of federal compensatory education (Chapter 1) funds in New York State school districts. To preserve local control over education, Chapter 1 aid for disadvantaged students is distributed through a three-tiered system involving a federal allotment formula, state distributions, and school district distributions. However, local decisions lead to considerable variation in actual allocations of Chapter 1 resources for individual students. Results of the distributional system are that the majority of students receiving Chapter 1 services are not poor, and that small districts, rather than wealthy ones, tend to be unserved. This study examines the New York State Chapter 1 situation in terms of the following factors:  (1) state and district allocation practices; (2) financial resources from federal, state, and local levels; (3) demographic factors including population, poverty, and population density; and (4) decisions at the local level. Data are analyzed individually and then combined to form a multiple regression model. Among the study's findings are that compensatory education program size is not closely linked to individual students' educational need, and that high poverty districts seem to run smaller, more expensive programs in New York State. The report includes two tables. A list of 41 references is appended. (AF)",

Six hundred male and female adults engaged in different educational activities in both basic and advanced education institutions were randomly selected from a population of l,000 and were administered the &quot;Reason for Educational Participation Scale Questionnaire&quot; developed by Burges in l97l. Usable responses were received from 265 males and 248 females. The Spearman Rank Order Correlation was used to analyze the data to identify statistical differences. The findings from the  study suggest that Nigerian adult learners engage in educational activities mainly for economic needs, self-development needs, social needs, and acquisition of credentials. Males and females had similar educational orientations. (Brief mention is made of the use of the data in program development. Sixteen references are listed.) (NLL)",

Education will never be more convenient or less expensive for students. Education is a product military personnel need and want. In a time of declining tuition assistance, it is up to colleges that deal with the military to market their programs to military officers and personnel, rather than just \"offer\" programs. All educators need to be positive about still-available tuition assistance, rather than negative about limitations and budget cuts. Colleges should promote degree completion programs as the opportunity of a lifetime. A good marketing and public relations plan should be drawn up. It should contain at least the following elements: (1) an identification and  assessment of the publics that constitute target groups or market segments for the program; (2) an identification of the most effective \"senders\" and \"channels\" for each target group; (3) an identification of what specific messages are needed for each market segment; and (4) a marketing plan, or at least a calendar for a year-round public relations program. College personnel who do not have skills in marketing can hire professionals to do it, engage marketing professors and classes in the effort, or take marketing courses and learn to market their programs.

        "description":"This document examines 8-year trends in the labor force status and other characteristics (including age and years of school completed) of persons with a work force disability, using March supplements to the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). (Disabled persons are considered to be individuals 16 to 64 years old with a disability that prevents them from working or that limits the kind or amount of work they can do.) The CPS data are collected by interviewers who ask questions about each household member 14 years or older in every sample household. The number of housing units eligible for interviewing in the sample ranged from 65,500 in 1980 and 1981 to 57,000 in 1988. Among the findings are the following: (1) the poor were more likely to be disabled workers  compared to those with a more comfortable income level; (2) Blacks were more likely to have a work disability than Whites or Hispanics; (3) the incidence of work disabilities is significantly higher among males 55 to 64 than among males 25 to 34, among people who have less than an eighth-grade education than among high school or college graduates, and among persons who live in poverty; (4) disabled males were unemployed at a rate of 14 percent over the 1983 to 1988 period, and men without disabilities were unemployed at a 6 percent rate; and (5) in 1988, 14 percent of women with disabilities were unemployed, compared to 5 percent of women who were not disabled; and (6) the unemployment rate for men with and without disabilities peaked in 1983.

        "description":"This document examines trends in employment, earnings, and education requirements among major sectors, industries, and four detailed industry groups (high tech, business services, health services, and eating and drinking establishments) in the United States. Trends show that the service sector, particularly in business and health services, are important sources of new jobs in the U.S. economy. Because the service sector tends to employ more college graduates, its expansion will tend to raise the educational requirements of jobs in the future economy. Yet the service sector pays lower average wages than the goods-producing sector, which could alter the distribution of earnings. The paper's first section contains a rationale for examining the industrial sector and includes a  description of the industrial structure of the economy. The second section examines differences in employment and educational requirements among industrial sectors and detailed groups. Differences in earnings among industries are the subject of the third section. The final section discusses the implications of the material presented earlier.

        "description":"A study was made to determine the extent to which Army reservists (the National Guard and the Army Reserve) are training in critical tasks and battlefield survival and to identify the factors affecting this training. Information was gathered by interviewing officials at headquarters offices, analyzing overall Army training information, and visiting 17 reserve component units. The study found that training reservists is difficult because of the limited time they have to train (weekends and one 2-week session yearly). Some of the obstacles found to hamper reservists' training were the following: (1) some Army schools provided little instruction on equipment that soldiers were expected to operate in their units; (2) some units lacked the equipment to teach critical tasks; (3) some  units did not focus sufficiently on training soldiers in tasks that support the units' missions; (4) units the researchers visited seldom incorporated survival skills in training exercises; and (5) scarce training time often was not used effectively. The Army is planning some changes in reservists' training. The study recommended that the Army ensure that reservists receive training on the equipment they will operate, in all job tasks critical to their units' missions, and in survival skills. It also recommended that it improve the management of training time and ensure that the strategy for training reservists is fully implemented. (KC)",

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) studied the implementation of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act in six states (Arkansas, California, Kansas, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) to determine if the funds are being used properly, to fulfill the objectives of providing vocational education to the disadvantaged and handicapped and encouraging program improvement. GAO found that, although Perkins Act funds, by and large, are being used appropriately to serve these populations, a number of problems exist in target funding allocations and data collection. For example, economically depressed areas in Arkansas, California, and Pennsylvania received less Perkins program improvement funding per vocational education student than do other local areas in those states. GAO  also identified program allocation mechanisms that tend to direct funding to more affluent areas and away from poor communities. Relatively wealthy areas are sometimes designated &quot;economically depressed&quot; for Perkins Act purposes and therefore provide greater per-student funding than truly depressed areas. and the students are sometimes classified as &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they are only academically disadvantaged but not poor, thus gaining a greater level of funding. Finally, disadvantaged and handicapped funds returned to states by poor communities can be reallocated to wealthier areas within the state. GAO also found that complete and reliable data on vocational education enrollment and spending were unavailable at either national or state levels. (KC)",

        "description":"Since its passage, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) has provided nearly $10 billion to state and local agencies to provide job training to unskilled and economically disadvantaged individuals who need training to obtain employment. The General Accounting Office (GAO) studied hard-to-serve JTPA participants and compared the services they received and outcomes experienced relative to less needy participants. Some of the findings of the study were the following: (1) JTPA is not targeting any particular job readiness group for enrollment in the program; (2) school dropouts were significantly underserved; (3) less job-ready individuals tended to receive less intensive services; (4) the quality of jobs received after leaving JTPA was strongly related to the skill level of  training received, regardless of participants' initial job readiness status; and (5) low skill on-the-job training was often provided for excessive periods of time, resulting in a subsidy to employers rather than true job training for the participants. GAO recomended that JTPA: increase its emphasis on higher and moderate skill job training; collect data necessary to measure differences in programs associated with such training; and monitor the effect of more intensive training on the number of participants the program can serve and on program outcomes.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) commented on H.R. 2039, which would amend both the adult and youth titles of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). GAO's analysis suggested the following: (1) although H.R. 2039 proposes to target greater resources to those who are hard to serve by requiring that 50 percent of adult JTPA participants have one of several employment barriers, it may not change things because 71 percent of adults served already fit that category--more effective would be to require multiple barriers; (2) the bill's proposal that participants' needs be assessed upon entry to the program has merit and would eliminate the practice of providing only job search assistance unless the assessment indicates that was all that was needed; (3) the bill would require  placement in jobs with career potential--an improvement would be to measure the extent to which participants are provided higher and moderate skill training, since participants who are trained in those skills get better jobs; (4) some changes need to be made to the proposed definitions and reporting requirements; and (5) Congress should be cautious in increasing the limits on administrative and support service costs because JTPA's current successful emphasis on training could be altered.

In this environment, the federal government must ensure that it is in a competitive position to get its fair share of talented graduates. Unfortunately, studies by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and other groups have shown that the government is not in a competitive position, and it is already having difficulties recruiting and retaining good employees. As part of its analysis of the reason for recruiting problems, GAO is exploring the attitudes of prospective employees toward federal employment. From the first five of a planned series of conversations with groups of college  students and newly hired federal employees, several themes appear to be emerging: (1) students say they do not know what jobs are available in the federal government and consider the application process to be confusing, untimely, and difficult; (2) students say they want fulfilling jobs, but believe that government work cannot provide excitement or satisfaction; and (3) students who would like to work for the federal government are discouraged by low pay levels, especially in high-cost locations.

Three major forces are restructuring the economy: overcapacity in traditional industries, the emergence of new technologies that are creating new service and knowledge-based industries and transforming old industries, and globalization in production and technology. These forces are transforming the economic role of federal, state, and local governments in the following ways: (1) the United States' economic dominance in the world has lessened; (2) the federal government's traditional macroeconomic tools of fiscal and monetary policy are not as effective in guiding national economic performance in an interdependent world economy; (3)  the ability of the federal government to shape the country's economic future is constrained by huge budget and trade deficits; and (4) states and localities will have greater responsibility and greater opportunity to shape their own economies in a competitive world. As geographical building blocks of the new political economy, counties should build the foundations for economic vitality in the new economy; strengthen the process of economic development; develop the regional economy; advocate sound economic policy at the state and federal levels; strengthen management to become proactive in managing events; and confront the key political choices that will affect the country's economic future.

Issues discussed include the following: (1) why retention is important; (2) gathering and analyzing information; (3) links between client recruitment and retention; (4) retention through intake; (5) technologies for increasing retention after enrollment; (6) improving on-the-job retention; and (7) retaining employers through good times and bad. The handbook stresses throughout that client retention is not an issue that begins after job placement; by then it is often too late. Retention begins with program planning and design, continues through recruitment, intake, program  participation, and job placement. The handbook points out some places to start. (KC)",

This study examined the effects on stress of an individual's social support and hardiness in a work environment. Subjects were 90 employees of an industrial firm and 50 undergraduate students who worked part-time. Sixty-eight subjects (49%) completed useable questionnaires measuring stress, perceived stress, social support, and hardiness. Results showed that, for subjects receiving low levels of social support, an increase in work stress was associated with increased perceptions of stress. However, for subjects receiving high levels of social support, increasing work stress was not associated with notable increases in perceived  stress. Results of this research support the theoretical concept that social support can moderate stress effects. Managers are in a position to encourage or prevent the development of social support on the job. Implications of the research can be readily applied through management action.

While the literature is clear regarding the relationship of P*E Congruence and well-being, one theoretical issue that needs to be addressed is the extent to which Person and/or Environment measures alone and in concert with P*E Congruence are predictive of well-being. This study examined the relationship of two Person measures and the P*E Congruence measure with well-being. Subjects (N=88) were males between the ages of 27 and 76 who were patients in a Veterans Administration domiciliary. Subjects were interviewed and completed a variety of questionnaires. Results  showed that overall well-being was significantly predicted by the interactive P*E Congruence dimensions and by the separate Person scales assessing functional status (OARS) and personality (NEO) and that of the three, the NEO was the strongest predictor of psychological well-being. The combination of the three sets of predictor variables resulted in a higher level of prediction than any of the three scales alone. The important point from these data is that there are common themes among the disparate Person and P*E Congruence variables predicting well-being, and there are concrete activities that can be used to positively impact well-being, and hence the quality of life, experienced by the patients in the domiciliary.

Nurse Aides I were told that if they chose to participate they would be evaluated by the nurse and the Nurse Aide II on the unit. Nurses' inservices included instructions on use of the performance appraisal. Approximately 43 percent of the Nurse Aides I elected to participate. Comments by those evaluating the aides and the participant aides themselves were collected. When results were tallied, 34 percent of the participant nurse aides (or 14  percent of the total) achieved the award. A commendation was placed in the personnel record of those who completed the program but did not achieve the award. Staff observations indicated that the program tended to increase bickering between nurses aides instead of engendering team work; participants dropped out due to the perception that their scores were lower than their performance; participants were angered and embarrassed if they did not achieve the award; and the administrative time was possibly prohibitive.

However, preliminary evaluations of the effect of respite care on caregiver burden have had mixed, limited, and in some cases null empirical findings of program effectiveness. This study explored the relationship between caregiver characteristics and utilization of respite care in order to understand the caregivers' perceptions of burden and social support as well as their need for formal support services. Subjects included 22 caregivers using respite care for families with dementing relatives and 26 demographically matched caregivers not using respite care. Also included were 43 caregivers of mentally or physically disabled children using the in-home respite care  program. Subjects responded to a questionnaire focusing on caregiver demographics, length of care, sources and availability of social supports, and attitudes toward and utilization of respite care. Results indicated that caregivers who used the respite care perceived a higher level of burden than did non- users. While differences in burden could be due to varying degrees of physical, cognitive, or behavioral problems that drive caregivers to seek respite, examination of severity, mental status, and prescription of behavioral management medications revealed no differences in the patient samples.

        "description":"Student characteristics associated with school failure and school dropouts are well documented. This study sought to determine if a subgroup of students could be differentiated prior to high school as at highest risk for secondary school failure and dropout. It also attempted to describe behavioral, academic, and familial differences and similarities between the hghest-risk students and their at-risk peers during the first 2 years of junior high school. Subjects (N=351) were sixth-graders who were rated by classroom teachers on the need for supervision; level of motivation; academic potential; social interaction skill; and teachability. Based on results, 78 students were classified as highest risk (HstR) and 273 were classified as at-risk (AR); the groups were reduced in size but  retained the statistical characteristics of the original pools; i.e., HstR was reduced to 24 students and AR to 29. In terms of junior high school adjustment, the HstR students could be distinguished from the AR students on intensity of unacceptable behavior. Results showed that AR students received significantly better report card grades than HstR students in academics as well as in work habits and cooperation. The HstR students were not absent more often than the AR students. In terms of predicting eighth grade adjustment, the teacher scale accounted for a statistically significant proportion of eighth grade variance for both groups in selective truancy, periods absent, report card grades, work habit grades, and cooperation grades. Results lend strong initial support to pursuing  research efforts testing the efficacy of targeting HstR students on the five item characteristics. (ABL)",

The studies mentioned in the annotations are discussed in a summary section. The report provides these conclusions: (1) classroom climate and teacher interaction with students is crucial in creating the needed socio-emotional climate to help maximize student achievement and motivation; (2) learning is enhanced if  motivation is internal although reinforcers may be used; (3) cooperative and individualistic goals are more likely to increase motivation since they decrease interpersonal competition and increase intrapersonal competition; (4) individuals who believe in their own competence will be more persistent, have an internal locus of control, and attribute their successes to ability and their failures to lack of effort; and (5) attribution retraining by emphasizing a student's personal causation in learning should be a major objective in motivation.

        "description":"Many recent studies have investigated the persisting negative impact of childhood and adolescent sexual victimization on later adult psychological functioning and adjustment. This study assessed psychopathology in a clinical sample of 30 women with histories of intra-familial sexual victimization, 22 women with histories of extra-familial sexual victimization, and 30 women with no victimization experiences, using the Diagnostic Inventory of Personality and Symptoms (DIPS.) The study examined whether the relative/non-relative issue was significant to the impact of sexual victimization experiences. All sexually victimized individuals in the sample had scores significantly different from individuals with no sexual victimization histories on the Affective Depressed, Dissociative  Disorder, and Neurotic Character Scales. Based on the primary Axis I diagnosis obtained from DIPS, the clinical sample of individuals with incest and sexual abuse histories were indistinguishable pathologically from each other, though distinguishable from those in the sample with no histories of sexual victimization. This finding suggests that the relative/non-relative issue is irrelevant to the impact of sexual victimization experiences. Both pathological family dynamics and similar victimization experiences are in a large part responsible for the similarities found in this sample. (Author/ABL)",

Subjects also responded to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Correlations were used to examine characteristics of the sample and to identify circumstances of their experiences of incest which significantly related to psychological adjustment. More severe psychopathology was found with brother perpetrators (who also used more force and violence) than with father perpetrators. Eating disorders were significantly more common in incest victims who had maintained secrecy about the incest, while disclosure significantly related to the absence of an eating disorder. The sample produced a mean Affective Depressed (AD)-Dissociative Disorder  (DD) code type and a mean Neurotic Personality Disorder Cluster Diagnosis. The AD-DD code type was also the actual code type seen in 13 cases. This subsample experienced significantly more severe sexual violation than the remainder of the sample. As the experience of the most severe sexual acts also related to increasing symptoms related to the dissociative disorder, researchers inferred that more severe sexual violation is implicated in the use of dissociative coping strategies.

When the target was the real self, unique traits (real only or ideal only) took more time for self-descriptiveness decisions than less distinctive (both) traits, whereas this time lag did not appear when the target was the ideal self. It was also observed that ideal-self decisions were made more quickly than real-self decisions, regardless of  trait distinctiveness. Traits judged to be descriptive of the real self (both or real only) were later recalled better than those not descriptive of real self (ideal only and neither), but there was no corresponding difference for those desired for the ideal self versus those undesired.

Moral dilemmas were used to ascertain percentages of care-based responses versus justice-based responses in 40 men and 39 women. Based on previous research, it was predicted that by increasing the level of importance of a given situation and the degree of difficulty in reaching a decision, one would find significant increases in percentages of total care responses in both men and women. It was also predicted that in decisions of lesser importance, men would tend to rely on a justice orientation while women would operate more from a care orientation. Results yielded support for all but the latter of these predictions. These findings deviate somewhat  from predictions based on Gilligan's theory that these orientations are predominantly sex-specific. Thus it is clear that the two orientations do in fact exist, but it is less clear under what circumstances sex differences may exist. Further research that focuses on situational differences and their relation to the responses of men and women is needed to clarify this issue. (References are included.) (Author)",

This model has the basic premise that with increasing age there is a corresponding decrease in a wide range of abilities. Not all research has agreed with the unqualified age decrement model. This study examined the relationship between an information-processing based test battery, job performance, and age using a sample of petroleum transport drivers (N=71). Only the Auditory Selective Attention Test (ASAT) and the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) were valid predictors in the information processing battery; they were significantly correlated with the number and cost of driving accidents and the cost of spills and blends. Older drivers performed worse than younger drivers on the ASAT  and the GEFT, the two valid predictors. However, there were no significant age differences in the costs of both driving accidents and spills and blends. The results suggest that an increasing number of driving accidents may have resulted from factors other than age. The results also suggest that when age differences in job performance occur, they are better explained by performance on valid predictors than by age per se. Thus the results bring into question the use of age as a surrogate predictor of job performance. (Author/ABL)",

All subjects selected completed seven paper-and-pencil tasks measuring well-known and reliable psychological phenomena. Self-esteem was found to moderate three out of six phenomena that were replicated: (1) acceptance of more responsibility for desired than for undesired outcomes; (2) the false-consensus effect; and (3) unrealistic optimism concerning future life events.  Attitude-consistency of cognitive responses to persuasion, primacy in impression formation, and beneffectance for social events were not moderated by self-esteem. No conclusions could be drawn about possible moderating effects of self-esteem on opinion change following counter-attitudinal role playing and attitude similarity/attraction.

        "description":"Developing an active, collaborative relationship between schools and parents, with a goal of enhancing the career equity guidance of young adolescents, is a difficult task. The school counselor, by training and school position, is often the individual change agent who spearheads the development of innovative programs designed to involve and educate teachers and parents in the career development and decision-making processes of their children. Effecting change in school settings can be a tedious, time-consuming and lonely procedure. Counselors must clearly articulate their programs to administrators, teachers, children, and more importantly, to parents. This document describes several ways in which counselors may work with parents and other community adults to create a better  involvement between the school and the community. These include: (1) identifying a problem; (2) the family and career development; (3) a longitudinal approach; (4) involving teachers; (5) involving the family; (6) reaching out; and (7) counselor-parent activities (career notebook night, parent groups, parent-training groups, career seminars, and parent support/discussion groups).

        "description":"While forgiveness has long been a crucial concept in the churches' formulations for the establishment and the preservation of spiritual, social, and emotional health, consideration of forgiveness by psychology pales in comparison. Research is needed to identify the psychological factors in mothers and fathers which serve as antecedents of the nurturance which they provide their children. In this study, college students (N=111) were asked to assess the nurturance they had received from their mothers and their fathers using a Likert scale. Scale items included \"I am an important person in my mother's eyes;\"\"My mother expresses her warmth and affection for me;\" and \"My mother is generally cold and removed when I am with her.\" The parents of the student participants responded to a  forced-choice forgiveness scale with items such as \"I am a very forgiving person, ready and willing to forgive anyone who has wronged me.\" The results suggest a strong relationship between self-reported forgiveness by parents and the degree of parental nurturance reported by their adolescent children. Mothers and fathers who reported the least level of forgiveness were appraised as having rendered significantly less nurturance than other parents. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"As with other illnesses, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a socially constructed phenomenon, not simply a biological entity. Biologically, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection causes immunosuppression, which in turn causes a spectrum of disease states. The official definition of AIDS by the Centers for Disease Control requires the presence of certain marker conditions. Those whose illnesses do not have these markers, but may have equal or greater impairment, are categorized as &quot;pre-AIDS&quot; or &quot;AIDS-related complex&quot; (ARC). This study compared the experiences of both patients with AIDS and patients with non-AIDS symptomatic HIV illnesses. Subjects (N=104) responded to a survey instrument encompassing demographic characteristics, social supports, economic  situations, and health services utilization. The extent to which the medical and socioeconomic needs of patients were being met was also assessed. Patients with ARC reported more unmet needs in most areas, often experiencing their situations as being in &quot;limbo&quot; or &quot;the gray zone,&quot; and in many respects seemed to perceive their life situation more negatively than did those with AIDS. A reorientation is needed away from thinking about persons dying with AIDS towards persons living with HIV infection. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Research on decision making in pregnant adolescents is in its infancy. Most has focused on correlates of the various pregnancy outcomes such as abortion, delivery, parenting one's child, or relinquishing the child for adoption. There is a need to investigate the process of decision making with pregnant adolescents in light of a theory of decision making, such as Janis and Mann's (1977) decisional conflict model. Adolescent mothers (N=54) with children less than 2 years old completed questionnaires about how they made their decision between parenting and relinquishment. Generally, girls gave high weights to self-approval as a mother and to self-disapproval in the event of relinquishment. They considered their parents' wishes to a lesser degree than their own, but they mostly  believed their parents wanted them to keep the child. Mothers and best girlfriends were the most influential people in adolescents' decision making. Girls who considered the decision the most completely were those who experienced the most negative effects of the decision, a situation which is not in line with Janis and Mann's model. Results suggest that efforts to promote decisions for relinquishment among pregnant unmarried adolescents need to concentrate on affecting the perceptions of self-approval of the adolescents in the event of both relinquishment and teenage mothering.

Faculty and staff are encouraged to informally \"adopt\" students. Homework is assigned three times a week. Evaluation of the program indicated that: (1) most Rice students were more confident about staying in school through graduation; (2) a followup of Rice students 1 year after exit showed that 40 percent had dropped out and 40 percent  were attending their home schools; (3) most of the Rice students were from low income families; (4) faculty turnover at Rice was high, a situation which may be related to the lack of salary incentives and special training; (5) gang membership emerged as a problem at Rice and the juvenile detention center; (6) the student teacher ratio at the juvenile detention center was 17:1; and (7) the recidivism rate for the juvenile detention center was 71 percent entered for the first time, 21 percent for the second time, and 8 percent for the third through seventh time.

Some researchers have suggested that theories of vocational behavior have had less relevance for females and other special groups because certain conditions that are relatively true for males are less true for females. This study examined person-environment congruence in the prediction of job satisfaction for college graduates over a 7-year period. College graduates (N=288) who had entered college 6 years previously and had taken the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory were surveyed. Job satisfaction and perceived congruence with college major were included in the survey. Gender concentration in jobs was operationalized from census data. Results  indicated that congruence between college major and job predicted job satisfaction, but congruence involving the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory and job did not. A three-way interaction between gender, gender concentration in occupations, and person-environment congruence was also found in the college major analysis. (ABL)",

Sexual harassment is defined, and nine forms of harassment are listed. The right to a life and an education free from sexual harassment is discused. Methods of dealing with the harassment are discussed, focusing on available choices and questions to ask oneself when deciding what to do. Five vignettes of students with sexual harassment problems are presented for students to suggest appropriate responses. Recommendations for helping victims of harassment are presented. For bystanders, it is recommended that they say they do not think  harassment is funny, tell the offender to stop, and walk away. For friends, it is recommended that they be supportive and help the friend document the harassment incidents. For schools, it is recommended that they have policies against sexual harassment and appoint someone to counsel students with harassment problems. The earlier vignette about the high school girl who is being harassed is continued with the girl's response. The booklet concludes with a checklist for students to determine if a school is prepared to handle sexual harassment problems. (ABL)",

In contrast, this study examined supervisor satisfaction with subordinates. Subjects (N=58) were bank supervisors attending a training program. Supervisors completed questionnaires on themselves and on their subordinates. The subordinates' questionnaires measured the functional relationship and included subscales on loyalty, cooperation, conscientiousness, willingness to work hard, follow-through, ability to think for oneself, taking and giving suggestions, honesty, and interest in the work. Entity relationships measured included biological, background, and value differences. Satisfaction with employees was measured using five  questions worded positively or negatively. The results indicated that if subordinates did things in such a way as to help the supervisor reach his goals (high on functional relationship), the supervisor's satisfaction with subordinates appeared to be enhanced. The effects of entity relationship differences were not based solely on biological or other background differences, but the perceived value differences had an important effect on reported satisfaction with subordinates. Functional relationships were important in the development of supervisors' satisfaction with their subordinates even after the effects of entity relationships were taken into consideration. (ABL)",

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, anxiety, and symptoms representing responses to assault and rape were assessed. After 9 weeks, subjects were divided into those with and without PTSD. A comparison between groups revealed that the scores of the  PTSD rape victims on non-PTSD symptoms such as depression diverged from those without PTSD and remained consistently elevated throughout the 12 post-rape weeks.

In investigating the relationship between learner initiative, literacy, and the ability to conduct a critical inquiry of a topic of study, seven college undergraduates were asked to direct their own reading and writing engagements enroute to composing a persuasive essay. The main sources of data for the analyses were video-taped work sessions, think-aloud protocols, persuasive essays that the students produced, and students' responses to the debriefing interviews. Analysis of students' think-aloud protocols and debriefing interviews indicated that the reasoning in which students were involved, and how reasoning changed across the task, was a complex phenomenon mediated by both specific  reading and writing engagements and the purposes for which these activities were undertaken. Results of the debriefing interviews, in conjunction with the think-aloud protocols and students' essays, revealed that an individual learner was capable of creating a kind of vicarious community of readers and writers exchanging different topical perspectives with one another as they moved back and forth between writing notes, reading articles, writing the essay, reading the essay, and reading their notes. Findings suggest that in order to foster students' ability to inform themselves about topics of study, ways of helping them begin to direct their own reading and writing activities in order to learn need to be explored.

The committees used \"A Guide to Selecting Basal Reading Programs\" (developed at the Center for the Study of Reading) to help them evaluate the quality of instruction in existing programs. Case studies of the three committees sought to address the following issues: (1) whether the Guide was helpful; (b) whether it helped committee members focus on the instructional content; (c) whether it influenced teachers in becoming more critical consumers of basal materials; and (d) whether there were factors which contributed to the use of the Guide. All committee members were asked to read the booklets in the Guide and were observed as they used the Guide to evaluate programs. Members were asked to  fill out questionnaires to find out whether the Guide was of help and to determine whether it helped them focus on the instructional quality of the basal reading programs. Structured interviews followed classroom observations to determine if teachers had changed their thinking or teaching behaviors. Results showed that 80% of the committee members felt that the Guide was helpful. Research indicated that use of the Guide improved the selection process by giving members information about current reading research, by providing specific criteria for evaluating basals, and by giving committee members a common framework in which to understand what they were evaluating. The extent to which the booklets helped teachers become more critical consumers depended upon each individual teacher's level  of prior knowledge and training. Four factors appear to have contributed to the Guide's successful use: time, enthusiasm of committee members, in-service training, and leadership.

Seventy-three normal hearing students were used as the control group. Booklets were prepared containing 30 control and 30 experimental sentences. There were two sets of control sentences and two sets of experimental sentences for each of four types (parallel function, pragmatic I, pragmatic II, and experiencer constraint verbs 1 and 2.) In the first set of sentences (parallel function sentences) the answers of both deaf groups differed from those of the hearing group. Repeated measures showed that the differences were significant for each  group of subjects for both the control and experimental sentences in reversed and nonreversed orders. When using the &quot;pragmatic II&quot; sentences, both groups differed significantly in their responses to both the experimental and the control sentences. For the experimental sentences involving type 1 verbs the hearing followed the verb constraint 95% of the time for the nonreversed order; the deaf only 54%. However, both the deaf and the hearing had difficulty with the nonreversed sentences. In sentences with type 2 verbs, deaf and hearing subjects made correct gender choices in almost every instance for the control sentences. For the experimental sentences, hearing subjects resolved the ambiguity by choosing the subject in almost every nonreversed sentence and deaf high school students  responded in a similar fashion. The differences between the way deaf high schoolers and deaf college students operate when translating small sentence contexts was identified. (Nine figures are included: 47 references and 2 appendixes containing background data on the subjects and analysis of statistical data follow.) (MG)",

        "description":"A series of studies addressed basic questions about instruction in subject areas such as science and social studies at the elementary level, focusing on group discussion of textbook content and addressing the effects of instruction in terms of students' knowledge acquisition and their independent reading comprehension of new content. Subjects, fourth grade students (144 in all), either read independently (a control condition), or experienced instructional treatment conditions created to distinguish two primary methods of treating text content during class discussion: (1) &quot;discrete&quot; instruction, which isolated brief segments of text for oral reading and subsequent discussion, modeled on conventional practice in elementary classrooms; and (2) &quot;integrative&quot; instruction, which  focused on larger content units and was designed to promote students' abilities to relate information within and across sections of text. Students read a series of 12 articles about three insect societies, in a specially prepared booklet over a 12-day period. A series of pretests and posttests was administered (to assess domain-specific factual knowledge, ability to use text as information sources, and approach to learning from texts), as well as daily tests (for understanding of factual information, ability to construct explanations, and application of knowledge in new contexts) and a measure of transfer to independent reading comprehension at the end of the study. Principal findings indicated that instruction significantly enhances both the amount and kind of knowledge students acquire.  Further, integrative instruction is more effective than discrete instruction with respect to students' knowledge acquisition and independent reading comprehension of both related and unrelated material.

        "description":"A study examined 1989 kindergarten (K) manuals of basal reading materials. The question of central concern was whether and how the manuals facilitate a teacher's efforts to match instruction with children's ability. A closely related concern was whether and how the manuals describe ways to keep some children occupied with useful activities so as to free a teacher to give time to others. Six examiners studied K manuals from six 1989 basal series and all met to discuss initial and overall impressions. To examine the nature of the lessons, 18 lessons were analyzed for the purpose of learning to what extent they were teacher-dependent. The numbers indicated that 83.7% of the activities classified were teacher-dependent. In addition, a large portion of the written exercises shown in  the K manuals--72% to 100%--require an adult's attention. The third question dealt with objectives given; results indicated that none of the six manuals ever encouraged the teachers to consider the appropriateness of an objective for a particular student. The manuals were also examined to learn about the phonics instruction they provided. The overall conclusion was that those who planned the K manuals did not keep in mind two facts about kindergarten: (1) members of the class need many different kinds of instruction; and (2) teachers need suggestions for activities that 5-year-olds are capable of doing without help.

        "description":"One of the tasks for the British National Curriculum Council has been to identify steps toward proficiency in the English language and, on that basis, issue descriptions of appropriate progress for students at each level and stage. There is a danger that teachers may view these steps as a linear sequence of accomplishments, each to be achieved in turn. Rather, language learning needs to be seen as recursive. Young writers are learning to make their texts explicit to a reader by using, for example, linguistic connectives which give a sense of coherence to the writing. In an analysis of speech and writing samples from five year olds, a greater variety of connectives was found in speech than in writing. However, six year olds in the same study displayed the reverse finding. It was  also found that they demonstrated a greater syntactic range when writing was purposeful. Writing samples taken from seven and eight year olds at a suburban primary school in England illustrate a number of different ways in which developing writers take account of a reader. Much of what these young writers are doing in their writing represents embryonic forms of what can be found in the writing of mature authors. The youngsters know how to provide context for their stories, how to build tension and excitement, and how to keep the attention of a reader. They also manipulate devices which make it known that they are aware of the reader and handle changes of time and parallel sequences. Teacher intervention will support these young writers best if it is informed by a deeper understanding of  what young writers can do. (MG)",

Subjects, 131 eighth-grade students, were taught a mapping technique which required them to analyze ideas into propositions and then arrange them into concept maps. Some students were assigned to one of two groups: one group read a content passage; the other read the passage and saw slides. The remaining students were in a control group which received no instruction. All students took a mapping test, a short answer &quot;classroom-type&quot; test, and an attitude questionnaire. Results showed that most students from all ability groups learned to use the mapping technique. Scores from the mapping  test were more sensitive to the increases in knowledge gained by reading and seeing the slide presentation than were those from the short-answer test. In addition, the mapping test scores correlated with other indices of schooling progress such as classroom grades and standardized measures of achievement. Although the diagnostic value of the tests seemed to be substantive and could be helpful to teachers and students as they attempt to determine what they do and do not understand, students did not express a positive attitude toward the mapping tests, as indexed by the attitude questionnaire.

        "description":"A review of the literature was conducted to summarize how characteristics of individual readers help to determine the nature and quality of their comprehension of specific texts and to discuss how this knowledge might be used by teachers to promote effective reading in their classes. Three dimensions of readers were identified as being causally related to comprehension. First, readers differ in terms of what they know. Readers who are highly familiar with the topic about which they are reading and or the organizational structure of the text they are reading comprehend better than those readers who are less familiar with the topic and organizational structure. Second, readers differ in terms of the cognitive skills and strategies they have available for use while they are reading.  Some readers have fully internalized a given strategy, such as predicting what should logically come next, others have done this only partially, and still others lack this strategy altogether. Third, readers differ in terms of their motivational orientations toward the text. Readers' attitudes about their comprehension abilities can be at least as important in determining their comprehension of specific texts as their actual comprehension abilities. Teachers who recognize the transactional nature of reading comprehension understand that characteristics of individual readers differentially influence their reading comprehension. These are the teachers who will be able to create reading lessons and programs to serve the varied needs of each reader in their classrooms. (One hundred  twenty-nine references are included.) (MG)",

To investigate whether an audience perceives the fundamental difference between development journalism (where the state has significant involvement in news decisions) and a free press, and whether that difference matters to the audience, a study examined attitudes in Mauritius regarding that nation's media and its credibility. Subjects, 502 adult residents of Mauritius, were interviewed regarding four elements of media credibility (whether the news is fair and balanced, tells the truth, gets to the bottom of the community's problems, i.e., problem-solving, and reports accurately). Interviews also addressed media-government issues (whether  journalists have a responsibility to report all the news, regardless of consequences; whether journalists should be licensed by the government to maintain high standards; and whether too much emphasis by journalists on conflicts and problems poses a threat to national development). Results included the finding that both television and newspaper journalism were rated quite favorably in terms of fairness/balance, believability, and accuracy. Results revealed a pattern of credibility and of different ratings for each news medium which suggest that this audience perceives the effects of government media control. Problem solving and accuracy in newspapers and television received comparable ratings in Mauritius. (Four tables of data and 28 notes are included.) (SR)",

        "description":"Combining linguistics and composition studies in a two-part article (in which part 1 presented the principal concepts of cohesion and information management used in spoken and written discourse) this paper, part 2, describes a model that applies some of these concepts in analyses of the content of samples of published writing in three disciplines (counseling psychology, biology, and history); discusses the findings of the analyses; and makes suggestions on how the findings can be applied in future research and teaching. The paper reports that chi-square comparisons of data revealed significant differences in cohesive density and in comparisons of the use of lexical ties: types, number of words entering into lexical ties, and the distribution of lexical ties in themes and rhemes.  Fewer significant differences in distributions of ties were found in themes than in rhemes, suggesting significant differences in the ways in which given and new information are managed in diverse disciplines. Eight tables of data are included. Twenty-six references and two appendixes (one containing tables showing levels of significance of chi-square tests of comparisons of data on cohesion and information management, and one discussing methodology) are attached.

        "author":["Kovarik, Bill"],
        "description":"A case study examined a 1920 controversy between two newspapers. One of the last vestiges of the era of &quot;yellow journalism&quot; was the editorial &quot;war&quot; between the Kansas City &quot;Star&quot; and the Kansas City &quot;Post&quot; which culminated in a 1921 showdown. The &quot;Star,&quot; a champion of main street interests and progressive Republican responsibility, was held in much higher esteem than the &quot;Post,&quot; known for its pursuit of scandals, lurid crimes, and sex sagas. And yet, when a nationally known public health expert, Dr. Charles North, spent the summer of 1921 serving as a consultant to the Kansas City government, he chose the &quot;Post&quot; as a vehicle for his campaign for mandatory milk pasteurization. North and the &quot;Post&quot; fired sensationalistic broadsides, accusing the town of Kansas City, its charitable  organizations and especially the &quot;Star&quot; of complicity in &quot;killing babies.&quot; Only pasteurization of milk could clear up epidemics ravaging the nation, North claimed. The &quot;Star,&quot; as a champion of small dairy farmers, opposed economic concentration of the industry that would result from a centralized pasteurization system. This unknown incident in the history of journalism raises questions about the use of emotion as a vehicle for arousing public interest in the details of scientific controversy.

Sixty-three constitutions or basic documents from the Western World, the Communist Bloc, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America were analyzed. Analysis revealed that most constitutions open with a freedom-guaranteeing clause and proceed (with great diversity in length, language, and priorities) to define the exceptions to that freedom. Findings suggest that it is not the length or the eloquence of the provision but the spirit behind its enforcement that measures a nation's dedication to the human right of freedom of expression.

The report included measures of students' writing, performance on district-made and standardized reading tests, and a follow-up on second graders. Statistical techniques of group comparison and pre-/post-testing were used to determine the effects of the program. One school site was chosen as the experimental group, and two school sites with comparable demographic characteristics were chosen as the control groups. Results indicated that writing scores of kindergarten and first grade children in the program were better than those of children in the comparison group. Reading vocabulary and comprehension scores of Writing to Read  kindergartners were significantly higher than those of the comparison group. First graders in the program received higher scores in reading and spelling. Parents and teachers responded positively to the Writing to Read program. The follow-up testing of second graders showed no significant difference in the average reading scores of the experimental and control group students. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of writing scores between the follow-up experimental and the control group; however, when average writing scores were obtained, there was a significant difference favoring the experimental group. The Writing to Read system appears to be an effective intervention for developing writing and reading skills in kindergarten and writing skills in first  grade.

        "description":"In 1984, a jury awarded $200,000 to the Rev. Jerry Falwell for emotional distress intentionally inflicted by a parody depicting Falwell as a drunkard who had incestuous relations with his mother in an outhouse. In 1988, in &quot;Hustler v. Falwell,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the verdict on First Amendment grounds. Although the &quot;Hustler&quot; decision has been widely hailed as a major victory for freedom of expression, this view needs qualification, and subsequent cases in the lower courts support such qualification. A critical examination of the Supreme Court's decision suggests that the decision confuses the concepts of falsity, believability, and opinion. Analysis reveals the Court's opinion to be far from clear. The Court addresses neither the question of how much protection  the First Amendment grants to opinion, nor the question of what constitutes opinion, nor the more general problem of plaintiffs' use of alternate theories of liability to avoid First Amendment obstacles to claims for libel. One result is that &quot;Hustler v. Falwell&quot; may not effectively discourage attempts to use intentional infliction of emotional distress as an end-run around difficult constitutional defenses to libel and invasion of privacy.

        "description":"News and editorial coverage of the Ponca controversy of 1879 was investigated in an effort to discover why and how this particular Indian story became a national crusade. The Ponca campaign helped promote reform-minded legislation which conferred new rights on the Indians and promised to speed their assimilation into mainstream society. The Dawes Act, which granted individual Indians tracts of land, was the culmination of the nineteenth century Indian reform movement. With publicity-minded reformers leading the way, the newspapers played a major part of the Ponca campaign and became promoters of the Indian reform movement. Without sympathetic news coverage and supporting editorials, in fact, opposition to Ponca removal and support for Indian reform could not have attained the  level of public attention that it did. Since the Poncas were peaceful people and had been clearly wronged by the Indian Bureau, it did not take much editorial courage to support their tribe. Press coverage of the Ponca affair was less the result of journalistic enterprise than of the activists on both sides. The newspapers never covered the story until after it had been promoted and then carried the story only through the lecture tour which had been arranged. Because the press was dependent on various partisans for its information, many issues of the Indian reform movement were never discussed or critically examined. By failing to investigate the story fully, the papers contributed to the superficial nature of the Indian debate. (Seventy-two notes are included.) (MG)",

The press portrayed a culture for which it had little abiding sympathy or understanding, consigning Indians to negative stereotypes which offered an inaccurate portrait of Indians or Indian life. Newspapers published anecdotes which defined Indians by their weaknesses, while Indians in conflict with Whites were invariably characterized as savage and violence-prone. Moreover, in contrast to Whites, violent Indians in news stories were depicted with no explanation of the causes of their actions, as if they were innately violent.  Additionally, the pre-telegraph antebellum press was based not on journalistic investigation or enterprise but on private correspondence, word-of-mouth reports and speculation, all sources open to exaggeration and error. Distortions, rumors, myths, and stereotypes in the media served an ideological function, namely to position the Indian at the margins of American life, to ensure continuing domination of Indians by Whites, and to preclude any moral confrontation with the idea of Indians as equals.

Literacy problems of different countries, emerging as they have from different cultural and political histories, require different proposed solutions--different not only from country to country, but different within each country, according to changes in political agendas. In the case of Rosen and Pattison, the former's perceptions were based on the lived-through reality  of a working class Jewish boy from London's East End slum tenements, while Pattison's notions were academic in nature and derived from an Ivy League east coast American WASP background. Each viewpoint was also subtly affected by the different political histories of both countries, which resulted in cultural cycles of dependency for the one and independence for the other. The need for multiple literacies and multiple approaches is further illustrated by differences of class, race, and gender consciousness between England and Canada. In all three countries the looked-for quality of access to literacy is not manifested in the goals and intentions expressed in rhetoric, but in the reality of the institutions where scholars work and conduct their business transactions.

Subjects were three students in a freshman composition class at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Recorded conversations of these students discussing their research papers in writing response group sessions revealed that the shift from power trips to empowering conversation in writing groups depends upon the student writer's conceptions of his or her writing problems. To a large degree, these conceptions are shaped by two attitudes the student brings to the group: (1) notions about what writing is and what purposes writing can, or ought, to serve; and (2)  willingness to engage in dialogue to discover purposes and to identify, describe, and resolve, if possible, discrepancies among various opinions. In terms of power, the student who resists the notion that writing is a dominating activity, who sees reading as a conversation rather than as passive acceptance or rote learning, who is willing to resist both the oppressor and oppressed roles, is better able to engage in empowering relationships.

The experiment used think-aloud protocols and comprehension testing in a mixed experimental design. Forty college freshmen each performed a writing task and a study task, in each case working with a 1,200-word reading passage which served as the to-be-learned material. The writing task led to lower scores than the study task on two of four comprehension measures. Writing and studying processes were analyzed along seven dimensions via the protocol transcripts. Stepwise  regression analyses revealed several significant relationships between process features and comprehension.

        "description":"An exploratory study investigated how writers represent their task to themselves before beginning to write. Using data from verbal protocols, the initial plans of 12 writers (5 experts and 7 student writers) who were working on an expository writing task were examined. The protocols were coded for types of planning. Independent measures of the quality of the subjects' plans and of the quality of their texts were also obtained. The analysis suggest that both the quantity and quality of a writer's initial planning may make a difference in the quality of the final text. A positive correlation between the amount of initial planning and text quality, and between the quality of planning and text quality was also found. In particular, the study revealed that writers who developed  rhetorical plans (i.e., plans for audience and purpose) tended to produce higher-rated texts. The data indicated that experienced writers build a rhetorical representation of their task. A rhetorical representation is defined as one which is rich in rhetorical goals and plans relating to the audience, purpose, form and language of the text, and in which the writer integrates his plans to form a coherent theory of the task.

It is also assumed that children's discourse forms and functions are in a dialectical relationship: the initially awkward forms children produce may have limited social meaning--but those forms may elicit social responses that imbue them with new functional possibilities and thus lead children to  further grappling with forms. In brief, the story forms young children learn from others are not the end products, but the catalysts, of development. (Five figures and one table of data are included; 30 references are attached.)

The document, &quot;The Student's Right to Write&quot; a series of individual essays, prepared by the Commission, was used as the basis for determining the positive and negative effects of the items to be judged by the respondents. Through statistical analyses of comparison and correlations, change is revealed in teacher preparation and teacher valuing of creativity and  motivation, and awareness of individual student needs.

Three midwestern newspapers were chosen--one small, one medium, and one large, in terms of circulation. Subjects were the managing editors of the three newspapers, 14 editors, and 49 staffers. Results indicated that there is widespread diversity among journalists on political topics and that political conformity did not  appear to exist in the three newsrooms in the study.

Of the 223 children, 95 were black and 128 were white. Forty-seven were middle class, while 176 were lower class. Social class was determined by the percentage of youngsters receiving free or subsidized lunches. Literacy instruction in all the schools was a traditional  reading program. For the study, each child participated in an individual writing session and was asked to write eight words and a sentence. A newly developed Confidence in Writing Scale was used to rate the children. Data analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results indicated that the middle class children were more confident in their ability to write than were the lower class children. Findings suggest that confidence in writing is related to social class differences rather than to race or sex. (A table of data is included.) (NKA)",

A study investigated whether readers of newspapers read graphics before or after they read the headline/text, and whether people decide to read a graphic device for appearance-related or content-related reasons. Subjects, 70 undergraduate students at two universities, were shown two separate &quot;packages&quot; from &quot;USA Today&quot; (one with a dominant graphic, and one with a non-dominant graphic) consisting of news articles, a headline, and a graphic device. They were then asked five questions based on the content of the graphic devices in the two packages. Results suggest that readers turn to graphics for both content-based and  appearance-related reasons, which may be based on individual tastes or on the dominant status of the graphic. For example, 70% of the subjects read the dominant graphic before the headline/text, while the smaller, less ostensible graphic was generally read after the headline and text. Results also suggest that readers went to the informational graphics largely for content-related reasons, indicating that there may be a need to emphasize the information in infographics.

George Hillocks' seven-level hierarchy represents an appropriate scheme by which teachers can sequentially move students to higher levels of critical thinking skills. The focus in this hierarchy is on two levels of comprehension: the literal and inferential, each with sub-levels. To illustrate this progression, works by Eloise Greenfield, an award-winning black author who has written a range of books for children, can be studied in the early grades. With the guidance of an experienced reader--the teacher--and a combination of freewriting at critical moments in the  reading process followed by class discussion, the elementary school child can be given the foundation for more complex ways of viewing literature. In later grades, the student will be able to move through Hillocks' final three levels, noticing the patterns of imagery or of parallel characters, determining the work's overall meaning, and relating the structure of the text to other elements of the work.

Within the context of one medium-sized comprehensive high school in a small city in the Midwest, the focus was on the daily classroom practice in teaching and learning to read and write. Four separate classes--two low track, one average, and one anomalous group, repeaters--under the tutelage of one teacher were observed to ascertain how students and teacher socially constructed their meanings of what it means to be a literate person. Methodologies were participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and audio- and videotaping. Findings suggest that differing curricula and pedagogies for each track produced different outcomes, with lower tracks receiving  less valued knowledge and less instruction in how to talk about knowledge in acceptable (in terms of schooling) ways. This insured that most students identified as remedial were taught in a way that resulted in their forever being identified that way: they learned to be remedial. (Forty-six references are attached.)

Students, 138 fourth, sixth, and eighth graders in a semi-rural school district in southern California, were instructed in informational writing through one of four instructional strategies: (1) presentation of model pieces of writing; (2) presentation of scales, questions, and criteria to guide writing; (3) presentation of both model pieces of writing and scales, questions, and criteria; and (4) free writing. The assessment included two scoring procedures, a holistic and an analytical evaluation. An unexpected finding of the study was the effectiveness of free writing, especially with below-average readers. Children reported that their problems in composition were mainly  problems of finding content for the text they generate, not of finding language to express the content. A picture prompt helped provide the content for the free writing activities and the students developed general fluency in writing. Such an opportunity to write may increase their awareness of text production from sentence level to text level. (One table of data and 19 references are attached.) (MG)",

The two disputants had lived together for two years and had made several purchases together. They participated in the mediation project to clear up their financial problems after they separated. The entire mediation lasted two sessions, and ways in which people might go about assessing good communication were explored. The study yielded six principles of good communication: (1) it is good to affirm and enact desired self-images and forms of relationships; (2) it is good to be clear about personal needs and goals; (3) it is good to understand and acknowledge the  meanings which other people hold for the world; (4) it is good not to create insoluble problems; (5) when good intentions lead to undersirable consequences, it is often useless to spend time affirming good intentions; and (6) it is good to initiate an action to change an undesired pattern of interaction. The evaluation was heavily context-dependent and presupposed certain inherent features of communication. The person who successfully exploits the communication process can be thought of as someone who calls forms of reality into being; who works to create this reality; who acknowledges that this game of creation involves other players; and who recognizes that although the game escapes conscious control, this does not exempt individuals from responsibility.

A recent survey of 183 institutions with major teaching focus on public relations (with 134 returns, for a 73% return rate), indicated that only one in four institutions offers a specific ethics course, and less than half of this group require it. Nevertheless, an overwhelming 93% of the respondents asserted that ethics is included in all courses. A thorough review of all texts cited as most used, however, disclosed slight or cursory inclusion of ethics in texts at all levels. If ethics is an integral part of the coursework, a major burden of that inclusion rests with instructors for significant discussion, lacking textual examples. Most of the ethics courses themselves focus on journalism, not public  relations. Ethics, largely neglected, or served with lip-service pieties, requires increasing attention in the public relations sequence. (Author)",

        "description":"Part of a larger project to design a production curriculum and measure the impact of this production activity on children's writing, visual thinking, and problem solving skills, a project developed an effective but inexpensive video for use in teaching animation processes to students at the elementary school level. The project used \"cutout\" or paperdoll animation--a simplfied form of cartooning that allows the same drawing to be used over and over--to dramatize a short script (an adaptation of a Scottish fairy tale, substituting aliens from outer space for fairies), and the animation was filmed on 8mm film. Audio production involved the taping of character voices and other story sounds. Both the film and the audio were then transferred to video tape for editing. The project took  six weeks to complete, and had a total budget of $200. A showing of the first edit was well-received by a sample audience (five children ages 9-12), who were curious about how the video was made and interested in making one of their own.

It maintains that whenever women are theorized about by scholars, those scholars are co-contributors in constituting ontologies for women's existence, and that it is therefore necessary to constitute perspectives that see women as speaking subjects in a heterogeneous process, for certain contemporary feminist theories and models that describe and explain women's discourse have failed to account for women as speaking subjects. Part one of the essay summarizes and critiques the muted group model (women seen as victims); part two summarizes and critiques the work of Jacques Lacan. Part three attempts to piece together the work of Luce Irigaray. The  essay argues that although these three frameworks have been insightful, they distort, disavow, and deny women's communication. In a final section, the essay utilizes the works of Julia Kristeva, detailing a cogent discovery of women as speaking subjects in the semiotic process. Twenty-seven references are attached.

        "description":"Students in a children and television course wrote their \"television autobiographies\" (that is, their relationship with TV). Forty-three students at a mid-size upstate New York college participated. The autobiographies corroborated the results of previous quantitative and qualitative research, but added a personal, more in-depth look at the individual members of television audiences. Entertainment and information were frequently listed as reasons for watching TV, but escape and companionship were special needs for some individuals when they were children. Many subjects remembered television more because of interaction with their families than actual specific content. Children sometimes used television programs and characters as the basis for play and imagination activities. In  terms of behavior, television affected subjects most in how they spent their time. It also affected what they talked about with friends and sometimes caused conflict with family members. Television influenced their play and provided role models to imitate. All but one of the subjects grew up watching educational children's shows on public television, and some programs were mentioned as instructional in social relationships. The most striking influence television seemed to have on the subjects was in the affective domain. Identification with characters often influenced how they felt as children not only while they watched a program, but also after the program ended. For most subjects it was the context of the television experience, not the content, that they most remembered. (Eighteen  references are included.) (MG)",

Two types of selectivity were considered: program selection before exposure and changing channels while viewing. The study included four indications of audience involvement: intentionality, or anticipating TV viewing; attention or focused cognitive effort; elaboration or thinking about program content; and distractions while viewing. Questionnaires were completed by 566 respondents who were cable TV subscribers who owned control devices, ranging in age from 15 to 93, from a wide geographic area. Partial correlations indicated that more salient viewing motives are linked to more search for television program information before viewing. Canonical correlation revealed that instrumental use  is marked by involvement during exposure. Ritualistic television use is reflected in higher selectivity before and during exposure, but less involvement during exposure. Results indicate that &quot;zapping&quot; is most likely part of a ritualistic viewing pattern. Future research should consider how audience selectivity and involvement influence media effects.

First, an extended Solomon design demonstrated that a pretest using short verbal descriptions of films had no significant effect on post-review interest. Repeated pretests showed that the procedure was highly reliable. Low, moderate, and high interest films were then selected to determine whether the effects of reviews were uniform for films of different interest levels and to ascertain what percentage of post-treatment interest was due to initial pretest  interest and to review direction. Review effects proved generally uniform across interest levels. Pretest interest and review direction combined accounted for 51% of the variance, but pretest interest alone accounted for 37%. Results suggest that an Initial Interest Modification Model of review effects is robust. (Two figures and three tables of data are included; 16 references are attached.) (SR)",

Findings indicated: (1) that news decision-makers discarded 78% of the information subsidies and kept 22% (in this first filtering); (2) that information from non-profit organizations and interest groups was kept most  frequently, while that from government-related sources and businesses was kept least frequently; (3) that subsidies with a city setting were kept most frequently, with a lower proportion of state and national stories retained; and (4) that planned event items were kept much more frequently than informative material, though 68% of the information subsidies received were informative materials rather than event-related.

Results indicated that the level of diversity  in cable programming has increased since the restrictive policy era of the early 1970s, but findings question whether cable has truly lived up to its potential for diversity.

Twenty-five inmates, all participants in a mass media communications journalism course at Pendleton Reformatory in Pendleton, Indiana, were videotaped while answering the question: How do you regard the treatment given you by the media during your arrest, trial and incarceration? Of the 25 interview subjects, 17 reported negative experiences with the media, four had good and bad reports, three expressed only positive feelings and one avoided the subject by talking about good public relations techniques. Ten conclusions were drawn from the taped interviews. They include: fairness, thoroughness, and objectivity should be observed by the media, including fairness to the victim,  the law enforcement people, the prosecutor, the judge, the court and the criminals; and reporters should dig deeper for the facts and not just settle for handouts from the authorities.

Content analysis of pictures was performed at five-year intervals for the years 1937 to 1988, checking for African-American presence in covers, and in pictures related to everyday life, prominent persons, social commentary, advertisements, entertainment, sports, and crime. Findings included: (1) the African-American percentage has increased from an average low for all three magazines of 1.1% in 1942 to an average high of 8.8% in 1988; and (2) the increase is  due largely to dramatic increases in everyday life, prominent person, and advertisement subject categories. This trend indicates the way the American media have evolved--from the stereotypical coverage of 50 years ago, towards more sensitivity on the part of editors to showing African-Americans as equal members of society, a trend which should be encouraged.

Max combines narrative genres (science fiction and film noir), television program types (prime-time episodic narrative, made-for-TV movie, talkshows), advertising and programming, and electronic and print media. Analysis of one channel of discourse, commercials and advertising, shows that neither advertisers nor textual theorists can rest safely on their assumptions. The text involved here is complex in the very sense that culture itself is complex, and readings of media that reduce complexity to a simplistic ideological positioning of readers are reductive and based on an overprivileging of dominance over the intelligence of  viewers, and their power to expose and exploit contradictory textual elements. By over-emphasizing the hegemonic and deemphasizing the emancipatory or oppositional, injustice is done to both the complexity of texts, and their potential for encouraging critical positionings among readers. Only through empirical investigation of individuals' readings in a consistent and systematic fashion will it be possible to determine the relationships between viewers and texts. (MS)",

All of the deleted policies and regulations, the criminal codes of California, Florida, New York, Texas, and Indiana, and the FCC's current character standards were examined. Results indicated that only six of the more than 20 deleted rules or policies treat activities which might lead to the types of criminal convictions now considered probative of licensee character. Results also indicated that the activities described in the other deleted policies, though possibly illegal, unethical, or poor business practice, do not rise to the  level of severity that the current Commission considers relevant in judging the character qualifications of public trustees. Findings suggest that only when the Commission begins its implementation of the new character standards will a clearer picture emerge of whether anything remains of the public's interest in being served by honest and principled broadcasters.

Broadcasters in the Roper study suggested that colleges and universities do an inadequate job in providing students with practical knowledge and in giving hands-on experience. Another major concern expressed by the broadcasters was that students leaving colleges and universities today have unrealistic career expectations regarding starting salary, job advancement, and misguided impressions of the industry. One of the pleasant outcomes of the Roper study was an apparent willingness expressed by broadcasters to help support the development of media education. The discussion prompted by the Roper  study could lead to genuine progress once the mutual misconceptions are overcome. Academics should recognize the key role played by industry involvement and should better appreciate the pressures of daily media production and media economics. Broadcasters should learn to understand bettter the role of a university and should work to recognize the political and practical constraints of the university setting. Broadcasters should continue efforts to produce and air the best possible programs which become models for aspiring broadcasters and create challenging standards for students to meet.

A survey (designed to measure practitioner roles and evaluation methods, background attributes, participation in decision-making, and attitudes toward the job and professional trends) was completed by 309 public relations practitioners (a response rate of 47.4%) from 12 major urban areas in Canada. Results indicated that, while women in public relations in Canada occupy the lower rungs of the professional ladder, exact location on the ladder  among women technicians appears to be a function of age and experience. In addition, though the best predictors of income differentials are years of experience and practitioner role, gender also remains a significant predictor of salary variance. Results also showed that women participate in higher-order decision-making as frequently as men, especially at the managerial level, but that the profession in general relies more on intuitive than scientific decision-making procedures. The study's similarities and differences to data on the same topic from the United States illustrate the importance of cross-cultural replication of professional patterns.

The test was comprised of conversations that would normally occur in either the high school setting or in the home and was developed in two different versions. The test consists of five sections each of which has ten questions, based on two or more stimuli. The sample included 397 high school students from around the country (218 females and 179 males) aged 13-18, who were asked to complete one or both forms of the test. Males scored consistently lower than females on all parts of each form of the test, a difference in keeping with previously reported gender differences. The standard deviations on all parts, and the total  scores, were lower than those reported for the adult video version of the Watson-Barker Listening Test. Although there was great variability among the testing sites, tremendous differences among the subjects, differences in motivation in subjects, and less than rigorous application of standard empirical control during much of the testing, the alternative forms of the test still were found to be significantly correlated, with each form capable of predicting a significant amount of the variation in the alternative form.

Subjects, 121 students at a large midwestern university who had visited the campus Student Health Center within the last 4 months, rated compliance-gaining strategies for both physicians and nurse practitioners across three health care scenarios. The three scenarios represented the extremes and the median in subjects' severity of illness ratings of 10  health care scenarios. Results indicated that subjects perceived physicians more favorably than nurse practitioners in their use of the &quot;request for feedback&quot; strategy across all three health care scenarios. Nurse practitioners were perceived more favorably than physicians in their use of the &quot;reassurance and empathy&quot; strategy in one of the three scenarios. Perceptions of physician and nurse practitioner use of the remaining four strategies did not differ significantly. In addition, self-reported locus of control did not discriminate subjects' perceptions of health care provider, compliance-gaining strategy, or severity of illness.

Grunig's &quot;Indices for Models of Public Relations&quot; (an instrument for measuring the type of public relations practiced by an organization) was of primary concern. This instrument places public relations practice into four models: (1) one-way asymmetrical primarily serves propaganda purposes; (2) one-way symmetrical provides dissemination of information; (3) two-way asymmetrical attempts to persuade; and (4) two-way symmetrical tries to develop mutual understanding. A sampling of 136 public relations practitioners from the state of Washington responded to the 16-item &quot;Indices&quot; questionnaire in order to describe their job. Results indicated there is  no significant relation between the one-way scales and the two-way scales and an inability to clearly distinguish job functions. This information indicates that the &quot;Indices&quot; may not be able to distinguish among the four types of organizations. These &quot;Indices,&quot; however, are clearly useful in distinguishing between the two types (one-way or two-way) of public relations organizations. The low explained variance and the low loadings on two items suggest that a more fully developed scale may be more useful. A larger number of items may not only increase the reliabilities, but they may also increase the differentiation among the four models.

        "description":"The difference between developed and less developed countries chiefly resides in the effectiveness of their administrative systems. This study attempts to identify and analyze the organizational constraints acting upon and within the Egyptian Ministry of Education that deter its capacity for administrative reform. Critical management processes are examined, such as policy formation, promotion procedures, planning, resource distribution, and local level decision-making. Field visits to several regional school systems and interviews with most of the senior ministry officials were carried out by a team of Egyptian and American researchers. The research is significant for providing close examination of a system closed to most Western researchers. Although the Egyptian educational  system is highly bureaucratic, it operates with an acceptable level of efficiency. The great challenge for change should come principally through a strategic planning process examining the present and future needs of the nation and establishing new, realistic directions. There is ideally such a strategic and policy formation body in Egypt. However, a ministry of education sheltered from external pressures for change, with its ranks filled by a seniority system and senior leaders close to retirement, operating thorough routinized procedures, and drastically underfinanced, has little incentive or means to effect significant reform. Included are 66 endnotes. (Author/MLH)",

Four out of 20 Dutch schools were persuaded to participate. Three members of the school management and about 30 teachers from each school were interviewed. The results suggest that one of the most important linkages used in schools was structural in nature with an emphasis on the instructional content. Textbooks played a central role in determining the content of the instruction, and teams used these textbooks as means to plan the instructional process. Findings indicate a strong belief on the part of all those interviewed that a high level of  coordination will increase students' achievement; findings also show that cultural linkages are the most important factor in generating students' learning outcomes. The importance of nationally set objectives to guide the instructional process was also noted, as was the fact that interpersonal linkages were scarce in the schools examined. (12 references) (SI)",

Young people, during their journey to a productive and fulfilling adulthood, need to see that they have a stake in the community, a meaningful role to play in it, and a reason for investing in its future. This book, divided into five sections, reviews the concepts underlying youth in community service, rationales and structural options for school-based service programs, the range of service opportunities, and the mechanics of starting and running a secondary school service program. Chapter 1 discusses youth as resources relevant to school-based programs and service and youth development. Chapter 2 outlines what it means to become a program \"champion\" and also  provides a menu of school-based service options and a basic planning checklist. Chapter 3 details getting the project under way, expectations, checking on the nuts and bolts, advice from the experts (the students) to adults, a ruminating checklist, and an operating checklist. Following this chapter is a section containing descriptions of 33 youth programs around the nation. A concluding section contains forms, checklists, and outlines related to administration, volunteering, the community, communication and leadership skills, and evaluation and reflection. Also included is a bibliography with 11 references and a sampling of national resources. (KM)",

This study describes a staffing committee that had been established in a large urban high school during the 1986-87 school year and responded specifically to referrals of students who were considered to be at-risk for dropping out of school before graduation. The paper discusses the difficulty of implementing interventions and the effectiveness of the interventions. The committee was responsible for monitoring persistent problems of at-risk students: excessive and chronic academic failure, low attendance rates, and inappropriate school conduct. Interventions included individual accommodations as well as building-level,  district-level, and community-level programs. The consideration of options for intervention within the school itself is recommended. The follow-up interview and a list of interventions are attached. (14 references) (SI)",

This term suggests a thorough, even radical, overhaul and redirection of the entire system. But the intent of these proposed strategies is the restructuring--not the destruction--of the historically successful American school system, now fallen on rather hard times. Basic strategies include (1) restructuring curriculum and instruction by raising state standards, using the effective schools approaches, giving priority to early intervention, using electronic technologies to bring education materials and experience to students while at home, and restructuring the teaching profession itself; (2) restructuring  the governance and finance of education by altering established control practices, initiating accountability legislation for financial support of schools, and encouraging school and business partnerships such as the adopt-a-school program; and (3) restructuring administrative power hierarchies and allowing parental choice of schools to instigate competition and encourage excellence. Almost all these restructuring strategies seek to preserve the essential integrity of the current school system. (KM)",

        "description":"Despite all the rhetoric about the quality aspect of small schools, the discussion inevitably boils down to a consideration of cost. The issue of cost differentials associated with school size requires an examination of the cost implications of alternatives. There are definite economies of scale associated with size; however, there also appears to be a point at which costs begin to rise relative to increased size. Research on school size provides support for the conclusion that costs do not automatically increase as schools get smaller and decrease as they get larger. When the actual costs are examined, it is evident that most cost differentials associated with size are due to personnel costs reflected in both pupil-teacher ratio differences and administration time. One should  not assume the inevitability of either short-term or long-term savings from either school closure or consolidation. It is perhaps too simplistic a question to ask if small schools cost more; the relationship between school cost and size is more complex than can be answered in a simple negative or affirmative response. The cost considerations of closure or consolidation or size in general appear far less in magnitude than those of the quality consideration of size. (11 references) (KM)",

First, the staff must define what is to be taught by the teacher and learned by the students. Second, all faculty members must be aware of the curriculum that is to be taught. Third, a plan with specific objectives and timetables to teach the curriculum must be developed. And fourth, continuous and intense supervision must be carried out by the instructional leader of the school: the principal. The success of the plan requires a commitment to improve, a systematic process of defining curriculum and instructional activities, and an extensive commitment of time by school  administrators to direct involvement in leadership on a daily basis and ensure that the plan is carried out at all levels of the educational system.

Formal planning is in many ways a controlling device, but it is also a potential enabling device through which participants can affect their futures. One academic year was spent studying three suburban or rural schools' political clientelism among the professional structures both on the school level and on the centralized planning level of the district; two of the schools were junior highs, and the third was a high school. Forty percent of the teachers, the principals, and other administrators were interviewed. The order observed in the schools' planning was as much a product of the political structure within the school--the irrational--as it was a product  of the rational structure; the compelling local interest in the schools was a defense of the status quo in terms of the principal's authority and the existing planning structure. In conclusion, it possibly is better not to conceive of planning as a rational process, but as a contention around which interests are expressed and alliances are formed.

Institutional collaborations occur when educational organizations combine their resources and personnel to improve the educational experiences of school children. Planning for staff development consists of three stages: mobilization, implementation, and institutionalization. The key to successful program planning lies within the efforts made during the mobilization phase; much effort, such as establishing a university liaison who is familiar with the decision-makers, must be expended before a planning session takes place. Preliminary discussions should  examine the proposed program's appeal to diverse groups of prospective participants, its realism and relevance, and its responsiveness to staff's and bureaucratic sponsors' needs. Additional factors to consider include the rotation of planning sites, prospective participants, the agenda, and a postimplementation program evaluation schedule. A working case study included in this document outlining the collaborative efforts of Kent State University, Ohio, and its elementary education intern and human genetics projects, serves as an example of the staff development program's goals and adaptability.

Data collection methods included participant observations, unstructured interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and composition writings. Seventy-two students were interviewed. Findings indicate that there is a correspondence between the tracking system of high schools and the tracking system in the yobiko, and it is explained in terms of different &quot;ideal-types&quot; of high schools. The tracking system in the yobiko tends to affect students' perspective on their life  and college education. Self-evaluation is affected by the tracking system of both high schools and the yobiko. The findings in this study offer some ambivalent evidence to the controversy between revisionist and meritocratic views of tracking: the study, however, did not utilize the very important variable of family background.

Addressing the law as it pertains to AIDS in the public schools, this legal memorandum outlines three legal theories that have been used to argue for the admission of students with AIDS. First, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 is explained, and four specific AIDS or AIDS-related cases are discussed. Second, the language of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975  (P.L. 94-142) is defined, followed by a discussion of three AIDS or AIDS-relevant applicable cases. And third, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is discussed. Other legal theories that seem useful but have not yet developed into reported court cases include the U.S. consitituional rights of privacy and reputation, federal statutes, individual state constitutions/statutes, and common law tort.

Key areas to cover in this meeting include (1) the reason for separation; (2) the positive aspects of the job; (3) the employees' feelings about their supervision; (4) adequacy of salary, benefits, and working conditions; (5) employee complaints or suggestions; (6) the possible existence of unresolved problems; and (7) separation formalities/information.

The survey instrument, based on a survey of 12 first-time high school principals conducted in five states and on a 1987 study of new secondary headmasters in the United Kingdom, was mailed to new principals in 16 states. The paper addresses the following five questions: (1) What immediate changes do beginning principals report making at the start of their first year? (2) What changes do they make as they progress through the first year? (3) How do they bring closure to the year and make plans for launching the next year? (4) What do beginning principals see as particularly difficult change-related challenges during the first year? and (5) Are beginning  principals' change efforts congruent with their vision or needs assessments? The analysis of data reveals that: subjects' early change activities focused on management and climate (morale); later activities focused on management and climate (support); end-of-the-year planning was weak and unfocused; and visions (especially related to instruction) were not achieved. Change was difficult, and principals exhibited a sense of lack of control over student management for instruction, administrative workload, attending to instructional goals, and resistant staff.

The school cultural orientations of seven male and five female first-time principals (10 white and 2 black), representing five states, are presented in this paper. Over the course of 1 year, principals were both interviewed by telephone biweekly and observed on three occasions for two consecutive days. After an examination of initial data, follow-up interviews were conducted focusing on: (1) the cultural linkages recognized, exhibited, and manipulated by the beginning principals; (2) the systems coupling patterns of these principals;  and (3) the leadership values the principals espoused and displayed. A final analysis of data revealed that the subjects were weak in building internal cultural linkages to improve instruction; exhibited tightly coupled patterns regarding most systems; and felt that they were providing cultural leadership by actions they inaccurately defined as purposing, empowering, and converting. Implications for future research and for principal preparation programs are briefly addressed. (KM)",

The solution to this question rests with the challenge of developing a thoughtful and balanced curriculum that includes a representative portion from each of four interwoven approaches based on Schiro's (1978) Scholar Academic (SA), Child Study (CS), Social Reconstruction (SR) and Social Efficiency (SE) ideologies. The SA ideology's primary goal is to  teach the knowledge that has been accumulated by the culture or to enculturate the learners. The CS ideology's primary goal is to tap the individual potential of each learner. Those who follow SR Ideology believe that their primary goal is to empower all learners to transform society. SE ideology concentrates its focus on the teaching skills and knowledge that will be productive in society. (JAM)",

Controversial issues, including differentiating between elementary and secondary principals, visibility of the superintendent, and teacher input in the evaluation of the principal are also analyzed.

This report delineates the problem, discusses why children carry weapons to school, and outlines strategies for keeping weapons out of schools and for improving school safety. Although some children carry weapons for &quot;show off&quot; reasons, too many regard the display and use of guns as a way of life. With an estimated 120 million guns in private hands in the United States, some of these weapons are bound to show up at school. Underlying the rationale for gun-carrying is our society's tolerance for violence as a way to resolve problems. Weapons may be detected through tips from students, use of security sweeps and searches, and  deterrents such as immediate suspension or expulsion, school security forces, crisis intervention teams, and metal detectors. Prevention strategies are important to help students feel safe without carrying guns to school. Some techniques are student/parent nonviolent contracts, community education programs, violence prevention curricula, peer assistance programs, and firearm instruction classes. To increase school safety, educators must be trained in weapons identification and detection, provide adequate supervision, and promote a positive campus climate by teaching social skills within the curriculum. Making campuses safe is everyone's responsibility. Twenty-seven references and supporting articles are included. (MLH)",

The educational organizations studied included a criminal justice training center, a color consulting school, a high technology educational center, a bank training program, a training center for the disabled, and a telecommunications employee training program. The study investigates claims that education in nontraditional sectors is more efficient and effective than conventional schooling in meeting educational goals and delivering instructional activities. Findings are based on interviews with program directors and staff members and an analysis of program  objectives descriptions. Initial observations suggest that education occurring outside the traditional sector is not organized in a manner wholly distinctive from traditional schools. The alternative schools exhibit many conventional organizational features, from the credentialed teacher and the credit unit to \"good faith\" controls rather than direct inspection of instructional or learning outcomes. In fact, alternative schools' resemblance to traditional schools probably helps them use the few technical control features they do exhibit. A second, broader study will further investigate alternative school arrangements and their organizational forms. The paper includes nine references and a table charting characteristics of an ideal technical control model for the six schools.  (MLH)",

        "description":"In most educational literature, the subject of costs has been isolated from curriculum, personnel, and program effectiveness. A dichotomy has existed between fiscal and curricular decision-making. The Resource Cost Model (RCM) was designed to help policymakers measure to what extent differences in the costs of educational services are attributable to price variations in comparable resources, students' programmatic needs, and the scale of school and district operations. The model has proved helpful at the national, state, and local levels. Although RCM was originally conceived as a purely technical model, it has great potential for bringing educators, resource management staff, and educational policymakers together to consider the most effective allocation of available resources.  This report summarizes discoveries about cost models for education over the last 5 years, focusing on processes and procedures. Specifically, the report discusses applications of the RCM at all administrative levels and compares and contrasts the nature of these applications. Also explored are differences in goals, implementation processes, and linkages between applications at different levels. The report also describes how the RCM fits into the broader context of strategic planning and introduces a prototype RCM database that may be used to expedite implementation processes. The RCM process succeeds by forcing competing and complementary program needs and interests to be considered in relation to one another. The document includes 64 references and 8 tables. A sample strategic planning  program plan is appended. (MLH)",

        "description":"The inadequate financing of public school facilities under the maximum class size requirements in Texas public education raises issues of quality and equity. In six chapters, this thesis attempts to examine the costs of facilities needs and to evaluate the options available to state and to local school districts. Chapter 1 states the problem and the background of the problem, which includes but is not limited to teacher shortages, inadequate facilities, and insufficient funding to exact compliance with Texas' legislative requirements. Chapter 2 provides a recent history of school financing in Texas. It outlines the major changes that have occurred since the Gilmer-Aiken bills of the late 1940s through the reforms of House Bill 72 in 1984. Chapter 3 looks more closely at the  effects of the provisions of the bill dealing with maximum class size. This chapter also examines some of the arguments advanced in the literature concerning the effects of reduced class size on student achievement. Chapter 4 examines current methods of financing school facilities in Texas and discusses the financial effects of reductions in class size for local school districts. Chapters 5 and 6 outline school facilities financing in other states and present options for Texas in dealing with the school facilities problems precipitated by the maximum class size requirement of House Bill 72. The conclusion is that the current law provides no flexibility for districts to design educationally sound options other than furnishing additional classrooms or to meet the requirement of lower  pupil-teacher ratios in the early grades by means other than providing for additional classrooms. This conclusion raises serious questions about the law's effect on improving equity in educational opportunity and outcomes. (JAM)",

This report represents an attempt to identify methods and procedures for producing an accurate measure of educational resource input price indices. The methods are largely mathematical equations that link student achievement to the unique social, political, and economic costs of education in a particular school district. When applied to data from school districts in Ohio and Michigan, the resulting EPI behaves reasonably because its variation is not excessive. Most districts fall in the range of 97 to 103 percent of the state average. The EPI is also stable in the sense that it is insensitive to minor changes in the methods of its derivation. It is recommended that future research concentrate on the development  of theory and on its application to a more accurate specification of the variables in the structural equations. (JAM)",

Each moral education program, if it is to be successful, must reflect the values and characteristics of the surrounding community. Among the many components of most moral education programs today are: (1) a policy statement outlining the program's educational philosophy and instructional goals; (2) an understanding that school personnel will be seen as role models for students; (3) a heavy involvement of parents and the community; (4) a study of the  Constitution; (5) an emphasis on academic excellence; and (6) opportunities to practice real-life moral behavior. Some special activities that schools with moral development programs have found useful include suggestion boxes, student/teacher/parent performance contracts, and heavily promoted volunteer programs. By all signs, moral education represents the wave of the future and of the present; perhaps public schooling in America is about to include the fourth R: Responsibilty. (KM)",

South Carolina's attempt to improve the quality problem was the passage by the South Carolina State Legislature of the Educational Improvement Act (EIA) in 1984; this act was amended in 1985 and again in 1986. Described are EIA prescriptions as well as resulting actions against schools whose performance does not meet the prescribed level. Whether or not the &quot;closedness&quot; of South Carolina elementary schools is one direct effect of  the comprehensive EIA mandates is uncertain. However, there is little doubt that any bureaucratic structure characterized by top-down decision-making, such as the one that exists in education in South Carolina, discourages participation, flexibility, and need satisfaction. At present, apathy and rigidity seem to characterize a great majority of elementary schools in the state. (18 references) (SI)",

Recommendations include: development of basic needs curricula founded on an analysis of the social, cultural, economic, and geographic characteristics of the students' environments; the development of curricula based on the analysis of both current and future needs in the students' environments; and the integration of  academic and practical skill training.

Child variables include child gender, birth order, severity of handicap, degree of child dependency, extent of attachment, age of the child, and presence of behavior and social problems. Parent variables identified are education level, socio-economic status, parental attitudes toward their child's development and special needs, parental age and family size, number of parents in the home, and type and quality of personal and professional supports. Professional supports such as early intervention programs may decrease or increase parental stress. Informal support from family members or friends  is related to low levels of parental stress. A model of family adaptation called the \"T-Double ABCX Model of Family Adjustment and Adaptation\" is discussed. The model identifies a pre-crisis adjustment phase, which is concerned with existing family types, strengths, and capabilities. The adaptation phase of the model concerns the family's ability to adapt to the crisis situation. The model looks at both the demands facing the family as well as the family's strengths and capabilities for meeting those demands. (Author/DB)",

Later support services include maintaining contact with the job development specialist and the provision of workshops, counseling and additional training as needed. Financial benefits to the employer include Targeted Job Tax Credits, wage subsidies from state and local agencies, and tax deductions for removal of architectural barriers. Other benefits include access to results of pre-screening and ongoing training support and technical assistance. The handbook identifies and gives corrective information for several popular misconceptions regarding handicapped people in the workplace. Appendices explain acronyms, define vocational terms, and list informational pamphlets and sources of job site accommodation assistance. (PB)",

The instructional procedure studied was &quot;Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review&quot; (SQ3R). Six experiments were conducted over a 3-year period, involving a total of 49 students. Data for the six experiments were analyzed through use of single-case experimental designs. General procedures for all experiments consisted of students retelling information after reading passages from history texts. Variables in the six studies included length of reading passage, reading level of passages, teacher prompts, and reading time limits. Results of the experiments showed that the SQ3R procedure had  little effect on students' recall of information. There was, however, a clear functional relationship between the length of passages used and recall of information, favoring passages of shorter length. (Author/JDD)",

The project reviewed the literature, developed a text analysis tool to determine if textbooks contain effective teaching strategies, analyzed 12 social studies and science textbooks at elementary and secondary levels, verified the initial analysis by teachers using the texts with students experiencing learning problems, and disseminated the findings at a national conference. Major findings in the textbook analysis were: (1) many textbooks failed to incorporate effective methods of instruction for students with learning problems; (2) most activities for special learners  were poorly integrated, often inappropriate, and dull; (3) textbooks for secondary students, in particular, seldom included important information about organizational, study, and test-taking strategies; (4) textbooks did not highlight text structures known to facilitate comprehension and recall. Recommendations are offered to publishers in order to make textbooks more usable for mildly handicapped students, and strategies are offered to teachers to make existing textbooks more usable. Nine appendixes making up the greater part of the document include appraisal forms, a resource packet, verification materials, the assessment tool, and materials related to the 1988 conference on improving textbook utility, including the conference brochure.

The guide recommends that the behavior change program begin with simple changes so that both the parents and the child gain experience in changing behavior. The guide is based on the principle that children act or behave to meet their needs and that behavior is not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; but rather &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Behaviors targeted for change must be objectively identified, antecedent events must be observed, and the level of the target behavior must be measured. A behavior change program can then be designed, involving positive reinforcement, prompting, shaping, and maintenance and  generalization techniques. Unacceptable behaviors can be reduced by identifying the consequences that follow from the child's unacceptable behavior and eliminating them. Existing techniques for decreasing unacceptable behavior include extinction techniques, rewarding an incompatible (acceptable) behavior, time-out, overcorrection, and severe punishment (not recommended and addressed only because some parents do resort to it).

The paper then identifies five ethical issues and value conflicts which have been largely ignored by both sides and discusses them in the context of the Regular Education Initiative. Issues include: (1) advocacy dilemmas; (2) value differences related to the purposes of education; (3) eligibility criteria for special education services which appear to exclude many at-risk students in need of intervention; (4) excellence versus equity issues; and (5) the impact of educational reform upon at-risk students.

        "description":"Vocabulary systems for individuals using communication aids can be broken down into two major types: coverage vocabularies and acceleration vocabularies. Acceleration vocabularies or word sets assume the individual is able to spell and words are chosen which speed up the rate of communication. Acceleration techniques may include sets of most frequently used words or syllables, abbreviation-expansion techniques, word prediction techniques, linguistic expansion, and full sentence storage and retrieval. This paper presents data regarding the coverage power of most-frequently-used-word sets, the effects of word length and keystroke analyses on calculated word set efficiencies, and the effect of different termination and abbreviation strategies. Word set analyses which do not take  keystroke analysis into account are shown to be overly optimistic due to the heavily skewed distribution of word length versus usage. A generic abbreviation algorithm is described which allows implementation and comparison of other strategies. Fixed-vocabulary, letter-based word prediction techniques are shown to be a form of cued abbreviation expansion with a relatively low motor efficiency. (Author/DB)",

Through the qualitative paradigm, the development of successful coping mechanisms was examined. The parents completed an instrument called \"CHIP, Coping Health Inventory for Parents,\" and all family members were interviewed. Subject families were recommended by professionals as coping successfully and also as containing at least one non-handicapped child. Disabilities represented were: deaf blindness, deafness, chronic illness, autism, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, and emotional disturbance with learning disability. From the results of the case studies it was possible to draw three generalizations: first, these families developed a broad repertoire of coping mechanisms; second,  the parents tended to have convergent accounts of how they coped; and third, the siblings interviewed all reported being able to freely question and discuss issues concerning the handicapped sibling. The paper proposes further investigation of three hypotheses: (1) there is a strong positive correlation between marital adjustment and satisfaction and ability to cope with a handicapped child; (2) there is a strong positive correlation between participation in a parent support group and ability to cope with a handicapped child and marital satisfaction; and (3) there is a strong positive correlation between parental ability to cope successfully and the psychological adjustment of their non-handicapped children.

Screen writing on a textured surface, involving visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic input, was used for instruction with 11 subjects, aged 14 to 20. Results indicated that screen writing and field experiences yielded higher word recognition gains than  traditional (flash card) methods of auditory/visual presentation of the word(s) combined with field experiences.

        "description":"The environmental context of the Trace Center is first briefly described as background for a more detailed description of the center's service delivery activities in the field of rehabilitation/education technology. Trace serves four major functions in rehabilitation/education technology. As a nationally funded rehabilitation engineering center, Trace conducts research in control, communication, and access to information technologies. The second major thrust is the development of new products, concepts, and information. Thirdly, Trace disseminates information via resource books, a reprint service, and a workshop series. Finally there is the support of four service delivery programs: the Communication Aids and Systems Clinic (emphasizing individualized access to communication  systems, primarily on an outpatient basis); the Communication Development Program (which serves non-school age clients with developmental disabilities primarily by coordinating existing therapy and support systems within each client's environment); Rehabilitation Research Services (which focus on equipment adaptation, construction, and one-time project development); and limited-term projects, usually involving outside funding. Program evaluation of any service delivery project should consider field coordination, program components, vertical integration, and competency of professionals, as detailed in a checklist. (PB)",

        "description":"The review of the literature on supervision research in Human Communication Disorders examined papers given at the national conventions of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) from 1972 to 1987, dissertations from 1965 to 1987, and professional journals from 1972 to 1987. Patterns and trends in the conference presentations are identified including more presentations on evaluating and assessing students than any other topic. Among concerns and issues raised are the need for further dissemination of conference papers. The review of dissertations notes that most studies investigated supervisor/supervisee conferences with other studies on supervisory styles, perceptions, expectations, affective behaviors, and effectiveness. Concerns are raised about the need to  resolve the question of supervisory effectiveness. The review of journals identified nine journals as the primary sources for refereed publications in supervision. Articles are classified into eight categories such as characteristics of student clinicians and methods/conditions of supervision. Concerns are raised about the high percentage of authors holding doctorates in contrast to the usual educational attainment of practitioners doing clinical supervision. Among overall conclusions is the need for more scholarly work in supervision especially to identify relationships between outcomes and aspects of the supervisory process. Over half the document consists of an extensive bibliography. (DB)",

During its first year the project served 308 students attending 25 public schools in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Project resource teachers met with a minimum of eight classroom teachers each week. They provided assistance in lesson planning, developed Spanish and English behavioral objectives for the content areas, identified and distributed suitable teaching materials and curricula, provided classroom demonstration lessons, assisted in the implementation of students' Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs) mediated  between target teachers and special education personnel, aided in developing and conducting teacher and parent training activities, and facilitated access to and use of the Regional Second Language Acquisition Centers. The project also held eight workshops on such topics as choosing the language for instruction and language assessment in a preventive-prereferral mode. Audiovisual and instructional materials in English as a Second Language were purchased and used at the Centers. The project also produced a manual and provided 35 tuition grants to teachers receiving special training. Recommendations for the next year include holding of parent and teacher workshops at local schools. (DB)",

        "description":"The monograph examines the roles of the two federal policy units, special education and vocational rehabilitation, that have the greatest impact on the initiative to improve services to disabled students in their transition from school to work. Chapter 1 is devoted to a discussion of the two methodologies used in the study: the value-critical approach to policy analysis and legislative history. Chapter 2 presents the legislative history of special education. Chapter 3 discusses briefly the federal disability policy system and presents a legislative history of vocational rehabilitation. Chapter 4 considers the interaction between special education and vocational rehabilitation from a value-critical perspective. It is argued that there exists a value conflict between the two  systems that jeopardizes the transition initiative. A fundamental conflict in the transition policy system is seen between the values of equality and efficiency. Because of this, special education must assume the responsibility for transition. Reliance upon the adult service system as an intermediary link in transition must be minimal. Court action to secure adult services will probably increase but it is questionable whether such mandates will be implemented given the political and fiscal climate. (DB)",

At that time, over 12.5 million postsecondary students were enrolled, and of these, 1.3 million reported that they had a handicap. The most prevalent handicap reported was a visual handicap, reported by more than one-half million students. The data also indicate that a higher proportion of students at 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions were handicapped than at 4-year and above institutions. Few differences were found in the characteristics of handicapped and non-handicapped students. Most handicapped and non-handicapped students were attending school  full time; most were white, non-Hispanic; and most lived off campus, not with their parents. The distributions of handicapped and non-handicapped students by major field of study were, for the most part, very similar in 1986. Handicapped students were only slightly more likely than non-handicapped students to be receiving financial aid. The report contains a section highlighting major findings, provides guidance in interpreting the data, and then presents the data (in tabular and textual forms) in three major sections concerned with incidence, characteristics, and financial aid.

Grammatical, or competency, errors were categorized by type and frequency. Analysis of the results shows the most frequent errors to be, in declining order of occurrence: in the use of articles; choice of words; in verbs; and in syntax. Contrastive analysis of Chinese and French revealed the origins of the errors. The number of errors was higher when the differences between the native language and the second language were greater, and most errors were the result of interference of the native language, confirming the theory that differences constitute learning barriers. It is proposed that the error patterns observed can be used in altering  instruction. Further research in error pattern changes over a longer period of instruction, exhaustive analysis of each error category, and comparison of oral and written error patterns are recommended.

The eight phonological segments considered were English consonant clusters and final consonants. Subjects listened to a recording of a text by a native English-speaker and then read the text aloud five times. A similar procedure was followed for a word list. Subsequently, an informal conversation between the subject and researcher was recorded. Error patterns were analyzed, making a distinction between errors due to interference and errors due to developmental factors. Systematic patterns of variation were found in the segments studied, conforming to predictions on order of acquisition based on native language transfer and universal grammar theory. Both positive  and negative transfer were evident. It is concluded that in second language acquisition there is a systematic relationship between variability, language style, and transfer and developmental factors. It is further suggested that while variability is a function of style, the amount of variability may depend on the speaker's proficiency. In general, accuracy increased with formality, with both transfer and developmental processes affecting devoicing significantly. Eight figures and a bibliography are included. (MSE)",

        "description":"It is proposed that the main emphasis in second language instruction continues to be on linguistic form rather than on meaning or content. In a review of literature, arguments are reiterated supporting the idea that meaning can be transmitted without having all the linguistic means of the target language at one's disposal. These arguments submit that first and subsequent languages are learned effectively only within a framework of meaningful use. The implication of &quot;meaningful use&quot; in the classroom context is then explored, drawing on transcripts of the language used in three content classes (history, religious education, and economics) and three language classes (one in French and two in German). Evidence suggesting much less meaningful use of language in the language classes is  presented. Some of the problems arising in purportedly communicative classrooms are considered, and a possible solution to some of these problems, designed to be attractive to administrators and parents and to enable teachers and pupils to achieve explicit objectives of language syllabuses is offered.

        "description":"Five experiments were carried out to gain insight into foreign language learning as it takes place in the classroom environment, and to create optimal learning conditions for beginning Swedish-speaking learners of English as a Foreign Language. The experiments examined receptive and productive comprehension of English vocabulary in Swedish-speaking students between the ages of 10 and 12. The students either had no formal English language instruction or had had less than one year of English instruction in school. The first experiment tested the uninstructed students' ability to identify aurally common English words and expressions, and the second experiment investigated the English-instructed students' ability to understand passages from fairy tales. The third experiment tested  the uninstructed students' ability to make lexical inferences from a text in which Swedish-English cognates were maximized and &quot;false friends&quot; excluded. Experiment four required the English-instructed students to write as many words as possible beginning with a particular letter, with the language unspecified. The fifth experiment studied the effect on vocabulary learning of playing a computer game with English vocabulary, in which new vocabulary was defined on-screen. Analysis of the five studies' results suggests that Swedish-speaking students have an English vocabulary of varying size when they begin English language study in school, and that the quality of the vocabulary depends on the type of input available to each learner, with input on topics of interest learned more readily.  Implications for instructional materials are considered. (MSE)",

Pupils were second- through fifth-graders, including native-Spanish-speaking, limited-English-proficient (LEP) pupils, and proficient native-English-speaking pupils. The instructional outcomes investigated include English and Spanish language proficiency, and academic achievement in mathematics. Data sets were collected between 1984 and 1987. The classroom environment was assessed by student perceptions of the degree of satisfaction, friction, competitiveness, difficulty, and cohesiveness in the classroom.  Analysis of the data confirms the important role of classroom environment and language proficiency in bilingual and second language learning for elementary school children.

Findings of the study, and the implications derived from the study, were examined for instructional program design. Results revealed that, for Spanish speakers, English acquisition is strongly related to native-language proficiency, and that, for the smaller proportion of students who become English proficient in one year, English proficiency at the time of enrollment is the best predictor of their subsequent second-language development. Based on these results, it is suggested that (1) educators make  provisions for differences in first-language proficiency when they design bilingual programs for Spanish-speaking students; and (2) studies be undertaken to determine whether this relationship holds true for native speakers of other languages.

However justifiable this is as a reaction to the move away from grammar and toward communication, it is a regressive step if the concept of grammar used is confined to outdated and invalid concepts. Applied linguists must seriously consider the advantages of contemporary models of grammar that have developed between 1980 and 1988. Neglecting these developments could progressively isolate the applied linguist from current and relevant research into native-language acquisition and second-language learning,  impoverishing the field of applied linguistics for language teaching.

        "description":"The Bilingual Resources for Development of Gainful Employment skills (Project BRIDGES) was a federally-funded program in its second year of a 3-year funding cycle. Project BRIDGES aimed at developing the academic and vocational skills of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students who had failed two or more classes and were at risk of dropping out. Students were selected for the program on the basis of low scores on the Language Assessment Battery (LAB). Students received instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL), native language arts, and bilingual or ESL content-area instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies. The project also provided support services, curriculum and staff development, and parental-involvement activities. Students achieved the ESL objective,  as well as the objectives of business and vocational courses by making gains on the LAB and on teacher-made tests. They partially achieved the objective for content area classes (in science and social studies, but not in mathematics), and the project met its attendance rate objective. The number of students served by the program increased to 456 from 346 in the previous year. Program strengths included the opportunity provided to at-risk LEP students for gaining employment skills, the high level of coordination among the three sites, and the project's special counseling services. The program's one drawback was a lack of parental-involvement activities. Suggestions for improvement include more homogeneous grouping in language classes, especially at the beginning levels where students are  unable to work independently. (Author/MSE)",

SBSTs were familiarized with new tools and strategies for assessing LEP special education students. A series of regional parent workshops familiarized  parents with the policies and procedures of the city's Division of Special Education and taught them how to help their children learn. Participating students showed significant gains in their English language skills, but did not meet program objectives in native language skills. Objectives were met in mathematics and social studies instruction, but not in science. Objectives were met in staff development, but not in identifying or developing assessment instruments. Evaluation of the parental involvement segment was not possible, and the program served fewer students but more staff members than the year before. (Author/MSE)",

Despite problems with the SPEAK Test, the measure was considered a valuable primary screening device. Several of the highest-scoring TAs on the SPEAK Test were not rated highly by students, suggesting the possibility of other variables affecting student evaluations. A questionnaire was administered to the students for evaluation of the TAs' communication style, and the students also completed the usual faculty evaluation form. The subconstruct &quot;attentiveness&quot; on the communicator style measure was the only  variable showing a high degree of correlation with assessments of teacher performance. Videotapes of the TAs in a mock teaching situation were used to further examine the attentiveness factor in the classroom performance of three of the NNS TAs.

Approximately 4 weeks later, usable responses were received from 353 respondents, for an overall response rate of 45%. Stepwise regression analyses were used to examine the subjects' responses. The analyses revealed that the following variables combined to predict the nurses' intention to quit: satisfaction with promotion, satisfaction with supervision, the nurse's age, perceived performance constraints, the nurse's marital status, and her/his employment status. These results are discussed in terms of  their implications for the management of nurses in hospital settings. The identification of promotional and career paths and the provision of supervisory training are suggested as areas in which hospitals should focus their attention in their attempts to manage nurse turnover.

The historical experience of American Indians with education provides a background for such underrepresentation in higher education, especially graduate education. Indian people in the past  have had education used as a means of forcible acculturation to American society. Though many Indian parents value education for their children, expectations of the results are often vague because they themselves have limited educational experiences. A barrier to Indian access to higher education is the family income level. The federal government has played the major role in providing education for American Indians, and the Indian Education Act of 1972 laid the basis for greater involvement of Indian parents in the education of their children and greater access for Indian students to graduate education. The fact that few Indian students choose to enter graduate programs is due to many deep-seated cultural and historical factors as well as the socioeconomic status of many Indian families.  Changes such as more financial opportunities and cooperation with tribal governments to respond to the needs for educational programs should be effected. (SM)",

The default plan's success largely depends upon whether the ED aggressively enforces the new regulations, and the extent to which institutional actions are actually contributing to defaults. Following a background of the default initiative (the problem and the ED plan), the following are covered: the final regulations (provisions affecting schools with high default rates, consumer information, guaranty agency program reviews, borrower counseling requirements, lender notification to  school on delinquency, school refund policies, information sharing, and annual information ED); the proposed regulations; administrative actions to reduce defaults; ED legislative proposals to reduce defaults (major default reduction provisions of legislation proposed as part of the fiscal year 1990 budget request, and legislation requested specifically as part of the default initiative); and analysis of the initiative (implications for schools, students, and program administrators).

Of this population, 72 returned the questionnaire; these organizations reported total expenditures of $8 million. Higher education programs and centers at universities constituted two-thirds of those not responding; a review of these organizations indicated that probably half neither received nor allocated research funds in 1982, and the other half probably received a total of less than $1 million. Data are  presented showing that federal grant and contract funds account for about 60% of all reported expenditures, with about 21% coming from private corporations and foundations, and reporting organizations contributing about 16%. Tables are presented showing a breakdown of type of research--disciplinary (fundamental and developmental) and policy (policy, evaluation, and descriptive)--by source of funds. The estimated total research and development (R&D) effort on higher education in 1982, $10 million, is discussed in the context of the diversity of topics, the R&D effort on all facets of education, and the R&D effort of business and industry. The role of the various funding sources and the need for research priorities are also discussed. (KM)",

        "description":"Administrators in higher education feel mounting pressure to link planning and budgeting as resources become more scarce and environments more uncertain. Instead of turning to theoretically prescribed planning/budgeting systems as solutions, microeconomics provides a means of thinking about individual consumption that helps shed light on the nature of the institution's financial problems. It illustrates the complexity of the problem and the inadequacies of prescriptive systems. It also suggests four characteristics of an optimal system that links planning and budgeting: (1) estimating change in income and prices, reducing uncertainty as much as possible; (2) allowing for disproportionate budget shifts; (3) monitoring and reflecting changes in preferences; and (4) managing  conflicting political pressure. If the decisionmaking process for linking plans with budgets is to be successful, it must: encourage frequent communication between planners and decisionmakers; ensure that similar or related decisions are made simultaneously rather than sequentially; and monitor important changes relating to income, cost, and preference, as well as calling attention to these changes so that they receive special notice. A brief description of an organization's use of the optimal systems is provided. Contains 2 references. (Author/KM)",

Examples are drawn from cases illustrating the different uses of information, showing some of the important costs and benefits of differing types of behavior in the people who provide information. Information professionals should recognize that, in addition to the traditional uses of information, other information functions that are critical to good decisionmaking include: identifying problems and alternatives; setting the context for action; inducing action; and promoting or legitimizing action. An alternative model of decisionmaking, multiple  advocacy, is presented. Multiple advocacy promises to increase the likelihood of information being used for decisionmaking in the typically nonrational, real world of higher education. The fundamental premise of multiple advocacy is that superior decisions result from consciously adopting a conflicting or dialectical decisionmaking process. Implications for data presentation and for the role of the information professional are also discussed. Contains 31 references. (KM)",

Program reviews can go wrong in three ways: in the use of data; in the conduct of reviews; and in whether, and how, the results are used. The fallacies involved in each of these three areas are discussed, for example, the \"single indicator fallacy,\" the \"perfect data fallacy,\" and several kinds of false assumptions and comparisons. Also discussed is the question of how a program review can  focus on educational outcomes rather than more traditional measures of inputs and efficiency. Three dimensions of the assessment of outcomes are explored: knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

Four obstacles to improved undergraduate effectiveness are pinpointed: (1) lack of visible commitment; (2) fragmented responsibility; (3) lack of incentives for improvement; and (4) lack of acceptable information about outcomes attained. In order to improve undergraduate instruction, academic leaders must change organizational structure and provide clear incentives. Several proven \"levers\" available to academic leaders to effect the necessary changes are discussed. Five broad directives, drawn from the experience of institutions that have tried new approaches to improving undergraduate  instruction, are given to state and campus leaders: insist on concrete information about student learning and development; create visible centers for improvement; create incentives for improvement; concentrate on the level of actual student experience; and use external requirements as opportunities for improvement.

        "description":"Meetings were held in Senegal in 1985, in Cote d'Ivoire in 1986, and in Zimbabwe in 1987, concerning the current state of higher education finance in Africa, the structure of unit costs, and the role of development assistance agencies and other sources of financial support. Reports are presented concerning the macroeconomic perspective, internal efficiency, external efficiency (manpower and quality), and alternative sources of financing (private sector contributions and student financing). Common views emerged on: (1) the unlikelihood of additional public resources becoming available for higher education; (2) the more efficient use of existing resources; (3) the substantial public sacrifice required to implement adjustment strategies; (4) the need to increase the private costs of  higher education, by reducing public expenditures on student subsidies and non-academic expenditures; (5) the need for curriculum and course improvement and promotion of regional collaboration through supra-national institutions; and (6) the need for continued financial and technical support from development assistance agencies. Meeting agendas and participant lists are appended. (KM)",

        "description":"Movements calling for reform in undergraduate education and the initiative for civic responsibility are traced, demonstrating that they have mutual concerns and self-interests. Though largely separate from and unknown to each other, their complementarity provides the basis for joint action. By integrating efforts to increase student involvement in public service with liberal arts curricular reforms which promote active learning and critical thinking, it may be possible to establish a model of undergraduate education that promotes the development of responsible and intelligent citizens. Four sections focus on the following: the context of change in higher education; liberal arts education and public and community service--distinct yet complementary traditions (the liberal arts  perspective and the public and community service learning perspective); the opportunity: to integrate the complementary perspectives of liberal arts education and public and community service learning to improve undergraduate education; and faculty are the keys to linking service and the curriculum. Drawing from and combining what has been learned from effective community service, substantive experience-based learning, assessment of liberal learning outcomes, and institutionalization of curricular innovations and teaching improvements, it may be possible to establish a means of effectively integrating public and community service-based learning into the liberal arts curriculum.

        "description":"Information on financing higher education in Japan is presented in the hopes that knowledge of the experiences in various countries and their analysis could benefit the efforts for finding future directions around the world. Financing of higher education is attracting international attention and is caused by demographic trends in many developed nations, fiscal stringency, and the conspicuous decline of equity as a social goal. These factors and others have helped erode one of the major rationales for greater public support of higher education. Thus, the public is reluctant to expand government expenditures for higher education. Three chapters are as follows: (1) outline of higher education finance (the higher education system, government expenditures and their flow, institutional  finances, and student support); (2) issues and recent reforms (historical background, finance of public institutions, public subsidy to private institutions, and non-institutional subsidies); and (3) evaluation and prospects (consequences of the changes since 1970, environmental changes in the future, and prospects).

Designed to help high school guidance counselors, students, teachers, and parents, it is the result of a survey of 41 institutions (public and private community, junior, baccalaureate, and graduate degree granting institutions) throughout the state. Institutions were asked to designate themselves according to a continuum of supportive services available to students with learning disabilities. The following categories were identified: no services available; decentralized and limited; loosely coordinated; centrally coordinated; and data-based. The guide provides only a description of services and is not an evaluation.  Several recommendations are suggested for ensuring a good match between student and institutions: research the institution; develop a profile; make contact with the institution; and contact the Division of Rehabilitation Services.

        "description":"Various issues related to the undergraduate education of adults are addressed. Adult learners comprise an increasingly greater proportion of the college student population, and these older students differ from traditional college students in significant ways, including their stages of development in life, value systems, outside responsibilities, and learning characteristics. The perspectives related to characteristics and special needs of adult learners that should require college faculty, administrators, and student services personnel to re-evaluate how they relate to the increasingly greater number of non-traditional students on campus are discussed. The focus of this paper is on demographic trends in the adult population, stages of adult development, values shared by adult  learners, and characteristics and special needs of adult learners. It has been observed that adults who return to college tend to be in transition and experiencing crises in their lives (e.g. divorce, unemployment, or geographic relocation). They tend to be sacrificing more than younger students to attend college and to be highly motivated yet lacking in confidence to succeed. Their developmental stages, values, study skills, and life experiences differ sufficiently from those of younger students that colleges should rethink their philosophies of teaching and foci of student services to meet the divergent needs that adult students have.

The first study phase consisted of summary data from 60 institutions on mean age, standard deviation, and median age of full-time faculty by rank. The second phase involved faculty attrition ratios such as the annual rate of faculty loss for each of several reasons. Another statistic from the colleges was the anticipated annual rate of overall faculty growth over the next several years. The third phase, formulation of the faculty replacement needs model, relied on attrition ratios and on actual faculty age distributions. Results suggest that: (1) the next 15  years will see a steep increase in the annual net loss of college faculty, with replacement exacerbated by growth in the overall size of the professoriate; (2) the distribution of current age, retirement year, total retirees, total net loss, total new hires, and the summary ratios are similar because retirees account for most of the year-to-year variability in these measures though only 17-37% of total net faculty loss; (3) faculty aging, retirement, and attrition appear to have a differential impact on various academic departments; and (4) probable needs in the late 1990s and beyond may be even greater than those projected if the quality of instruction and research at American colleges and universities is to be maintained or enhanced. An appendix describes departmental clustering  (humanities, sciences, social sciences, and other). Tables and charts are included. The paper contains 14 references. (SM)",

        "description":"The use of merit scholarships to keep bright students at in-state colleges is discussed. Today more than half of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) states have credited merit scholarships to encourage their top high school graduates to attend in-state colleges. While athletic scholarships often receive greater visibility, SREB states are providing more than 11,000 state-supported scholarships based on academic performance. These scholarships are in addition to the even larger number of merit awards funded by gifts to public colleges and universities and through programs designed to encourage students to pursue certain major areas of study. Standardized test scores and high school grades are most often used to determine who is eligible for merit scholarships. Details on  such programs in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Florida, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia are presented. It appears that states are successfully encouraging many of their top high school graduates to attend college in their home state. However, the direct influence these scholarship programs have on students when they are making a college choice is not clear. States may need to change programs to allow, at a minimum, preliminary award notices to be sent out to applicants no later than the beginning of their senior year of high school since in most cases, awards are made in the late spring or summer immediately preceding the graduates' freshman year in college, by which time most students have selected the college of choice.

        "description":"New educational standards and programs designed by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) states are expected to help achieve national, and increasingly international, standards in education with the goal of readiness for college. Improving college readiness, or reducing the percentage of entering college students who need remedial work, is a major concern of educators and governmental leaders. Several issues related to preparing students for college and important questions for monitoring progress toward the goal are presented. Estimates of the number of entering college students who need remedial coursework and information on special high school diplomas for college-bound students and high school academic courses required for admission to public colleges and universities  in the SREB states are noted. Few states currently have in place state-level information systems that can provide answers to some of the critical questions about students' progress through elementary and secondary school and college. The 20 important questions about getting students ready for college are examined (e.g. percent of students enrolled in college preparatory programs in the high schools, process for periodically assessing the quality of courses offered in the high schools, and how well the students are doing on nationally normed tests of achievement). College preparatory curricula are defined, and suggestions are made for improving the quality of college preparation and monitoring the progress toward the goal. Tables are included. (SM)",

        "description":"A survey of new and continuing undergraduate students was undertaken at the end of 1986 to obtain information on the related issues of costs of studying and access to equipment for study purposes. Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 2,400 students at the Open University (OU)--1,200 students taking their first OU course and 1,200 continuing students. The overall response rate was 75.4%. Analyses of the student responses indicated that one third of the students (33%) have access to some kind of microcomputer than can be used for OU study purposes, of these, 18% have a microcomputer at home; male students are far more likely than female students to have access to micro equipment; the quality of access that men have to micro equipment is better than for women; and that access is  best for students taking courses in mathematics, technology, or maths/science/technology. This report provides analyses of the data in both narrative and graphs for access to microcomputers by age, OU status, sex, occupation, region, and course profile. Data are also analyzed for various factors related to the use of microcomputing equipment in the home; access to a microcomputer at work; features of the microcomputer system to which students have access and their experience in using microcomputers; and the effect of the home computing policy on students' study plans. Additional survey data, a tally of student responses to seven questions on the 1986 costs/access questionnaire, and list of reports available from the Student Research Centre in the Institute of Educational Technology are  appended.

A discussion of the methodology used to summarize the studies is followed by a description of the results and conclusions about the effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of the types of training that were investigated. The studies show an almost exclusive interest in simulation that extends from full-task, highly realistic simulators to part-task, lower cost simulators. The data show that simulator-based training is effective in developing performance proficiency; some transfer from simulator-based training to  performance on actual equipment occurred in every case. Speed of performance was initially slower on maintenance tasks for simulator-trained students than for those trained with actual equipment. As expected, simulator training was found to cost less than training with actual equipment. The types of cost and effectiveness data collected in these studies do not permit an examination of trade-offs between cost and effectiveness. Future studies of training should examine functional relationships between effectiveness and cost and include sensitivity analyses of key variables that determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative training approaches.

A quantitative meta analysis was performed of 31 evaluation studies concerned with interactive video instruction. Across the evaluation studies reviewed, interactive video instruction was found to be more effective than conventional approaches to instruction. The effectiveness was enhanced further by the utilization of more interactive features and directed rather than  freeplay simulations. Use of interactive video can increase training efficiency by increasing opportunities for practice and requiring students to participate more actively in instruction. Three studies indicated that retention using interactive video instruction is at least equal to that found using other instructional approaches. Interactive video is a promising and cost-effective medium that will have a significant impact on military systems. An executive summary of a study of the effectiveness of interactive videodisk in army communications training and a list of organizations contacted are appended. (58 references and 2 tables) (GL)",

        "description":"The Computer Pilot Program of the Division of Computer Information Services of the New York City Board of Education was designed to investigate the claim that comprehensive computer-based instruction (CBI) might best be used to improve the basic skills of educationally disadvantaged students. This ongoing project is designed to identify comprehensive CBI programs and implementation factors that can combine to positively affect the academic performance, attendance, and attitudes of educationally disadvantaged students. In the 1987-88 school year, 13 such programs were placed in 26 elementary and secondary schools in New York City. The investigation consisted of site observations, interviews with staff members and students involved with the programs, statistical comparisons of  students' 1989 and 1988 scores on city-wide tests of reading and mathematics achievement, and questionnaires sent to the vendors of the CBI programs. The programs were generally well received by both staff and students, and their use generally resulted in significant achievement gains; however, students in the lower grades tended to show greater gains than students in the higher grades. Almost all of the programs involved both computer management and computer delivery of instruction. All but two programs covered reading, language arts, and mathematics, and many covered other subjects as well. Most of the programs used a task-analytic, learning-by-objectives approach, and about half of them were designed specifically for remedial populations. Most ran on either IBM, Apple II, or  proprietary networks. This report summarizes these findings for each of the 13 programs evaluated. (BBM)",

Despite these difficulties, there have been indications of a growth in the incorporation of computer conferencing in distance education activity. Issues requiring more careful consideration if computer conferencing is to make a greater impact on distance education include: (1) scale (expansion of computer conferencing capability to larger groups while at the same time assuring that low-socioeconomic status groups have access); (2) integration (incorporating computer conferencing into existing distance education programs); and (3) optimization (deciding where the  medium can be used most effectively). While the major emphasis to date has been on enhancing the learning process by encouraging group learning and facilitating peer counseling and tutor feedback, other potential applications include enhancing group processes during course development and facilitating the management of decentralized distance education infrastructures by reducing the necessity to travel large distances for staff meetings. Further research is required on suitability of conferencing software for specific purposes, cost implications, and modification of software to suit individual user needs. Because of its capacity to bring people closer together without necessitating physical movement, computer conferencing has larger societal and global implications. (26 references)  (GL)",

Two phases can be recognized in the Dutch experience: one from 1984 until 1988 and one from 1989 until 1992. Building upon the experiences of the first phase, research plans for the second phase are outlined. General conclusions are that research plans should be formulated within a concrete and well-defined framework, oriented more toward implementation issues than toward theoretical research questions and undertaken in a context of international cooperation. Priorities for the next phase of research include: (1) procedures and criteria for software evaluation by teachers; (2) alternative approaches to the inservice training of  teachers in computer usage; (3) computer applications in vocational education; (4) cooperative learning and computers; (5) the effect of computers on higher cognitive skill development; (6) the applicability of artificial intelligence techniques to the production of courseware; and (7) the development of interactive coaches.

Contributing factors include spiralling population growth, government policies to achieve universal primary education, attempts to reduce high teacher-pupil ratios, and the shortage of professionally trained and/or academically qualified teachers. Strategies that have been adopted to remedy teacher shortages include the use of: (1) double shifts with increasing teacher-pupil ratios; (2) expatriate teachers; (3) increasing female participation; (4) home- or community-based school equivalency programs; (5) in-school equivalency programs; (6) school broadcasts; and (7) inservice teacher education through distance teaching. The University of Nairobi (Kenya) currently  provides correspondence courses which include radio broadcasts and face-to-face teaching during occasional residential sessions. The University of the South Pacific has Extension Centers in 10 of the 11 participating countries which are linked to the main campus in Suva (Fiji) through satellite audio-teleconferencing. The University of the West Indies also uses satellite teleconferencing to offer courses for the 14 English-speaking Caribbean islands. Three main campuses are located in Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados; and University Centers are maintained in each of the 11 other countries.

Pursuit of rewards may offer teachers career recognition and profile in school systems but may also, if taken up in an unreflective way, lead to injustice in the classroom and hinder achieving desirable social and academic goals. This peril is illustrated in a case study which examines the practice of one teacher who was given a computer in response to a successful proposal to do research in her classroom. Despite the fact that use of the computer did not significantly contribute to her goal of improving students' writing skills, the teacher continued to use the new technology and, because only one computer was available, restricted access to only a select group of students. Through  the use of computers in their classrooms, teachers obtain a powerful language for communicating their interest in innovative methods to university people, others involved in new developments, and administrators looking for centers of innovation. This institutional reward structure makes it difficult for teachers to reflect on the value of new technologies and thus exercise the virtues of honesty, courage, and justice which enable them to make their practice worthwhile. Reflection on practice in relation to its institutional setting is critical because it alerts teachers to the ways in which the institutions of schooling can undermine their own practice. (GL)",

An impact systems model developed by Glasman and Bibiaminov (1981) has been adapted to facilitate measurement of change in a school's outcomes. This model examines cognitive and affective changes brought about by change in a school's inputs, including student background, school conditions, teacher characteristics, instructional integration of computer use, student attitudes, type of computer use, and hardware and software characteristics. Application of the model to the improvement of computer impact involves examining variables from the  perspectives of manipulability and critical upper and lower bounds, which involves the determination of which variables are most important to the successful functioning of the overall system. The model can guide strategy for the improvement of computer impact in schools. The final level of consideration for decision makers relates to identifying effective mechanisms for manipulating critical variables toward &quot;upper bound&quot; characteristics, where particular variables are powerful enough to make the system likely to be successful regardless of other variables. Three possible intervention approaches are increased funding, changes in national or regional policy, and changes in teacher training or retraining. (GL)",

A total of 125 students in grades 9 to 12 were observed, with 47 students in marketing, 18 in social studies, 29 in English, and 31 in stenography classes. The objectives of the study were to determine: (1) the effects on student behavior of grouping at the computer (individual or paired), student keyboard status (keyboarding, not keyboarding, taking turns), gender, type of class, gender of partner if applicable, and academic discipline; and (2) the effects on teacher behavior of student grouping at the computer (individual or  paired), student gender, and academic discipline. The study provides evidence that two contextual variables--student grouping at the computer and academic discipline--seem to be related to social processes in the computer classroom. These variables produced variations in the nature and frequency of student behaviors, with students who were paired being more verbally active and showing more positive reactions to their work. There were also differing responses across disciplines, probably linked to the particular curriculum that was observed. Teachers involved in whole class activities, as compared to individual interactions, gave a higher than expected frequency of procedural information. Results of analyses of the data are displayed in 22 tables. (5 references) (GL)",

        "author":["Munro, Jane"],
        "description":"Research studies trying to understand, predict, and control dropout from distance education display various points of view and quite a few build on one another at a conceptual level, but their findings are rarely generalizable outside the situations in which the research is conducted. Although academics claim that new work on dropout should be based on theory appropriate to distance education, dropout is a single symptom with multiple causes, and a deductive analysis based on almost any reasonable model (let alone a fully-developed theory) is likely to explain only a small portion of dropout. An inductive approach (such as the use of grounded theory) might produce more practical information about dropouts even if it did not clarify theoretical issues in distance education. A  review of the existing literature suggests that, besides the negative implications, dropout can be a healthy choice for a mobile or independent learner. Such a review raises a number of unanswered questions about dropouts in positive and negative circumstances and takes the researcher into the broader social context of education where theory from such disciplines as sociology, anthropology, political science, or economics (rather than psychology or curriculum design) might prove meaningful. By using these new frameworks to examine the nature of discourse of dropout in distance education, researchers may recognize ways to reconceptualize the problem and collect data that will speak less from the registrar's point of view and more about the experience of students.

        "description":"In response to a series of problem symptoms related to the influence of television on students, a team of professors at the Universidad de Playa Ancha de Ciencias de la Educacion in Chile undertook a project designed to train television viewers to become critical viewers of the medium. Specific objectives of the project included: (1) to design a methodology to teach students to critically interpret television commercials; (2) to develop a curriculum to promote active viewing for use in both primary and secondary education; and (3) to develop a program of family education aimed at modifying family practices that might promote excessive and indiscriminate television viewing. It was decided that the audience of the project would include primary and secondary school teachers and  pre-service teachers and that the program would be field tested in a local primary school using pre-service teachers from the developers' institution. To investigate the influence of family conditions on students' perception of television messages, a descriptive investigation was conducted in the same primary school. This investigation resulted in the development of low cost learning units for use in a future program for training parents to promote critical viewing on the part of their children. Future directions for this project include a focus on the family's influence, the development of critical viewing programs for broadcast on educational television, and further emphasis on improving the preparation of teachers in this area.

        "description":"In January 1987, California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), began to explore the potential of interactive videodisk (IVD) technology on its campus. The challenge of introducing an individualized instructional technology into a cost conscious and conventional teaching environment was formidable, considering the traditional orientation of instructors and the existing reward structure. Demonstration projects in business, chemistry, and foreign languages were developed to illustrate the multi-disciplinary nature of IVD. A simple-to-use IVD lecture authoring/presentation system was developed. A CSUF directory videodisk, intended to inform users about academic and nonacademic programs at the university, was designed and programmed in order to demonstrate the versatility of the  medium to administrators and gain their support. In June 1988, CSUF hosted a two-day symposium for 140 faculty members of the California State University system in order to disseminate information about the IVD program. The formulation of a CSU IVD consortium was proposed and discussed. In September 1988, California State-Fullerton's successes resulted in the receipt of educational grants and industrial contribution to allow it to begin to assemble a multi-disciplinary IVD learning center. The center, comprised of 10 IBM InfoWindow Systems, is located on the main floor of the central library and scheduled to begin operations in the spring of 1989. (Author/GL)",

        "description":"The purposes of the &quot;Pilot Study for the Active TV Viewer Scholar Education&quot; project were to find low cost teaching methods that developed critical television viewing skills among elementary and secondary students, and to develop a parallel program of family education in an effort to modify family viewing practices to encourage critical viewing. This report supplies specific information on the design and implementation of programs to meet project goals and the dissemination of information about the project through conference presentations and publications. A review of programs developed and field tested in various schools throughout Chile in 1984-85 indicates that the development of a critical viewing curriculum was not suitable for the national reality; rather, training teachers  in the theory and practice of active television viewer education, enabling them to produce their own materials, was considered to be a more effective approach. A projected area for future investigation by the Universidad de Playa Ancha de Ciencias de la Educacion is the analysis of the effects of a wider variety of media on students. A regional workshop is now developing a methodology to teach skills in critical analysis of materials written by the press, and other institutions have asked for technical support to develop similar programs to enhance the use of educational media. A proposal has been submitted to the national government and National Television of Chile for the development of a national distance education program with similar goals. Efforts to generate international economic  and academic support for the pedagogy of mass media projects are also underway. (GL)",

A learning system is described that supports a number of delivery modes, including individualization or customization of instruction. The first part of the report examines some of the long-term trends impacting education and develops an image of the future of education that might be used to guide today's educational planning. The second part of the report describes the proposed learning system, which uses Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) networking strategies to manage individual learning projects for students in the classroom. The steps for developing such a  network-based curriculum are outlined, and strategies for implementing the curriculum and evaluating students' progress, teachers, and the curriculum itself are discussed. Recommendations for the nature of educational facilities and software requirements that would support the individualized curriculum are provided. The report concludes with an outline of a preliminary plan for building a network-based learning system capable of meeting educational requirements at an individual, school, district, regional, provincial/state, or national level.

The second part reports on a study of the feasibility of using expert systems for technical processing in the Library of Congress, which collected data through a series of interviews and onsite visits to determine potential candidates for the application of expert systems technology. The report includes discussions of: (1) the methodology used; (2) the characteristics of a suitable expert system domain; (3) potential applications, i.e., shelflisting assistant, series consultant, and subject cataloging consultant; and (4) operations that were ruled out as potential applications areas, i.e., cataloging in publication,  decimal classification, descriptive cataloging, National Union Catalog (NUC), exchange and gift work, ordering, overseas operations, and serials management.

        "description":"This report addresses solutions to problems of fungus growth on library materials. The first of four sections--&quot;What Is Mold? Where Does It Come From?&quot;--defines mold, mildew, and fungi, and describes their optimum environment (i.e., generally in conditions with temperatures above 70 degrees and relative humidity above 78%). The second section--&quot;What Does Mold Do to Books and Paper, and to People?&quot;--discusses some effects of fungi such as mold and mildew, including: (1) an increase in the rate of book and paper deterioration by accelerating the aging process and the formation of acids; (2) mold and mildew stains that destroy text and images; (3) a weakening and softening of books and paper, making them difficult to handle; and (4) adverse effects on human health. The third  section--&quot;The Repulsion of the Giant Spore, or How To Rid One's Collection of Mold&quot;--makes up the greater part of the report. It prescribes methods for inhibiting the growth of or killing fungi, with emphasis on nontoxic, nonchemical environmental control measures for both prevention and cure. Other nonchemical (e.g., freezing, gamma radiation, and ultraviolet light) and several chemical (i.e., fungistatic and fungicidal) treatments are also detailed. The fourth section--&quot;Concluding Recommendations&quot;--advises that fumigating collections with toxic or hazardous chemicals is rarely necessary for dealing with mold and mildew problems, and provides a checklist to consult before instigating chemical treatments.

        "author":["Sullivan, Kathryn"],
        "description":"The popularity of DIALOG database searching causes problems when requestors do not understand how the service operates or how to fill out a search request. This report describes the implementation of a computer-aided instructional (CAI) program, which was developed using the UTAH PILOT programming language, to convey basic information about DIALOG to students in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences at Winona State University. The program was designed to demonstrate how to do simple DIALOG searches in ERIC and biomedical databases on 5.25 or 3.5 inch disks in the computer laboratory. The CAI program was divided into three parts: (1) an introduction to DIALOG and the basic commands; (2) a brief review and a quiz; and (3) examples of an actual search in DIALOG. The CAI  simulation was designed to allow students to learn about DIALOG services while fostering an appreciation of why some searches do not provide the desired results. It is noted that, although no students who had completed the CAI program had availed themselves of the opportunity to conduct an online search under librarian supervision, a definite improvement had been observed in both the number and the quality of the online search requests submitted from the College of Nursing. The report includes background information about DIALOG; a brief literature review; and discussions of the implementation of the program, pilot testing results and subsequent changes in the program, and the outcome of the project. The appendixes, which make up the greater part of the report, provide two examples from  the CAI program and a copy of the complete instructional program. (12 references) (SD)",

The project also included field testing of the curriculum guide by participants in an institute on library service to jail populations, written evaluations by users, and reports from practitioners on how they had  used the manual. The introduction provides background information about the project and the compilation of the resulting guide. The next three sections report on the implementation of the project, including the people involved, the process used, issues addressed, and problems encountered; the results; and the development process. The evaluator's report by Peggy O'Donnell which follows the narrative report includes the project objectives and outcomes, evaluation methodology, the developmental process, the institute and the guide, major concerns about the guide contents, a follow-up evaluation, and conclusions and future recommendations. Eight appendices provide lists of the members of the Planning Committee, the Advisory Group, reviewers, and institute participants, as well as evaluation  response sheets, the telephone interview form, and the table of contents for the guide.

        "description":"This study was the first phase of a multiple phase project to generate knowledge about the creation and rapid growth of information and referral (I&R) services in public libraries in the United States in the late 1960s and the 1970s. I&R service is defined as facilitating the link between a person with a need and the resources outside a library to meet that need. The study was implemented by administering two surveys. The nationwide survey polled one-twelfth of U.S. libraries about the extent of I&R services provided; sources of I&R innovation; and administrative factors. The focused survey polled all public libraries that provided I&R services about the background of I&R; sources of I&R innovation; I&R services offered; service delivery and administration; and evaluation of I&R  services. The response rates of the two surveys were 43% and 66%, respectively. Analyses were based mainly on descriptive statistics. Following an executive summary, eight chapters provide: (1) an overview of I&R in public libraries; (2) a description of the two surveys and the response to them; (3) a discussion of the types of I&R services provided by the participating libraries; (4) a more detailed examination of the I&R services delivered in the libraries studied; (5) a description of the delivery systems used for I&R services; (6) an examination of various facets of the management of I&R services; (7) a discussion of the findings of the study and recommendations; and (8) a description of a half-day symposium on public library I&R that was delivered at the 1979 American Library  Association conference in June 1979. Questionnaires and data from the two surveys are appended. (6 references) (SD)",

(2) When resistance to technology does exist, what are its related attitudes, beliefs, and reasons? (3) What are the values of technology as seen by librarians? (4) Do librarians differentiate personal and societal values regarding the acceptability of technological innovations? (5) Are personality variables related to resistance to technology? and (6) Is resistance to technology related to work  environment and professional self-perception variables?

The Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) has emphasized that ERIC products and services should be more widely available and should be used by more diverse audiences. Achieving that goal hinges on three factors: receiving additional resources, applying new technologies, and adapting systemwide management policies. A framework for system improvement, put in place during the 1987 competition for ERIC Clearinghouse contracts, already has begun to implement mechanisms to improve the quality of information in the ERIC database, coordinate systemwide products  and services through the creation of ACCESS ERIC (a new system component), expand publications, establish a network of ERIC Partners, collaborate more systematically with other federal education programs, and identify and index critical statistical information. Future system improvement options are also discussed, such as expanding database and journal coverage, developing the capability to store and retrieve full-text documents, creating expert search systems, enhancing electronic dissemination, developing new publication series, and marketing ERIC products and services in ways that better reach practicing educators. The concepts for ERIC system improvement will be more fully developed in a document--&quot;ERIC in the Year 2000&quot;--now under development. An address and telephone directory of  the components of the ERIC system is attached. Scope notes describe the areas of coverage of the individual clearinghouses. (3 references) (Author/MES)",

This study investigated the information search process of 140 high school seniors in six high schools. Subjects were identified as high, middle, and low achievers from homogeneously grouped English classes. Findings verify a six-stage model of thoughts, actions, and feelings in the information search process. There was a significant change in students' thoughts, actions, feelings, and confidence during an information search which correlated with the teachers' assessment of focus in the students' papers and grades on the papers.

State public libraries may use the grant funds to coordinate and plan library literacy programs and arrange for training of librarians and volunteers to carry out the programs. Local public libraries may use the funds to promote the use of voluntary service of individuals, agencies, and organizations in providing literacy programs and to acquire library materials, use library facilities, and train volunteers. In fiscal year (FY) 1988, 224 grants totaling over $4.7 million were awarded; grants ranged in size from $1,000 to  $25,000, and averaged $21,370. This report examines and analyzes the types of projects funded in FY 1988. Section 1 discusses probable trends and major directions taking place in the Title VI projects; Sections 2 through 11 discuss and give examples of common elements that characterize the projects. Three appendixes, which make up a large part of the report, provide (1) a list of the types of activities undertaken in individual FY 1988 projects together with a code for each activity; (2) a list of projects by state and library which gives for each project the name and number of the library director, the telephone number, amount of funding, and codes for the activities engaged in; and (3) a statistical report and analysis of the program, which includes descriptions of the activities listed  in the first appendix.

        "description":"In this report, the General Accounting Office (GAO) responds to a July 8, 1988, inquiry by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing about the Government Printing Office's (GPO) efforts to acquire and supply microfiche copies of government documents to approximately 1,400 depository libraries. In August 1987, GPO had terminated its sole microfiche contract with Automated Datron Inc. (ADI) because of ADI's poor performance. At that time, the flow of microfiche versions of government documents to libraries virtually ceased. Since then, a microfiche shortage has existed, which the GAO expects will continue for some time. The report consists of a short letter summarizing the results of the GAO's analysis, two appendixes, and three tables. Appendix I: (1)  supplies background information about the establishment and maintenance of depository libraries and a synopsis of microfiche contracts; (2) identifies reasons for delays in microfiche distribution; (3) explains why the ADI contract was terminated; (4) details actions taken by the GPO to alleviate the microfiche shortage; (5) describes GPO contracting procedures; (6) describes how GPO generally complied with its contracting procedures; (7) explains why the GPO allowed ADI to compete for replacement contracts; (8) discusses the replacement contracts for which ADI competed; (9) analyzes the reasons for further delays in replacement contracts; (10) reports the number and status of microfiche awaiting GPO testing; and (11) assesses actions taken by the GPO to correct the microfiche shortage.  Appendix II lists major contributors to the report. (CD)",

Each of the six topical sections of the report discusses the instructional potential of information technology, realization of the potential, and predictions for the future. The first section addresses new resources, e.g., computer software, to support learning by individualizing instruction; bringing the outside world into the classroom; accessing vast amounts of information; processing complicated data; and providing microworlds, i.e., some kind of bounded universe, for student exploration. The second section approaches the expansion of computer and information sciences as a new curriculum  situation, particularly at the secondary level, assesses its current success, and suggests other uses for its tools than are typically offered in schools. The next two sections evaluate changes in the organization of student interaction during learning experiences and additional changes in the role of the teacher. One such change may relate to the move from textbook-related class preparation to teachers creating their own instructional materials, using IT to design and create courseware. The fifth section discusses changes in the physical organization of educational situations within the traditional school building, and the sixth section describes changes in the macro-organization that IT has the potential to create.

It is suggested that these databases are useful to libraries because, in addition to subject indexing, they have &quot;word access,&quot; e.g., to names of people, products, companies, or geographical regions. By using word access, librarians can more efficiently track down such elusive elements as a quote from a speech that may never be indexed in a bibliographic database. Databases that provide up-to-date information include: (1) databases designed to provide current records for an older file; (2) full-text databases; (3) wire-service databases which make full-text  information available immediately or shortly after being transmitted to newspapers; (4) databases that quickly index current sources; (5) summaries of news stories; and (6) press-release databases. Five such databases are used as exemplars: Newsearch, AP News, Washington PressText, Washington Post Electronic Edition, and USAToday Decisionline. The discussion of each database focuses on variations in the database structure, subject access, and search strategies, with emphasis on the DIALOG versions of these files.

        "author":["Gordon, Carolyn"],
        "description":"This paper examines the problems encountered by part-time English instructors at Cuyahoga Community College (CCC) and describes an effort undertaken to address them. An informal survey in the spring of 1988 of 36 part-time instructors as well as administrators and program coordinators found general agreement that, despite the provision of sample syllabi, lists of resource faculty and mentors, part-time faculty development efforts fell short of the need. Specifically, from the 22 questionnaires returned, five points were identified as matches and/or mismatches between part-time teachers and the delivery and management of instruction: teaching experience, degree preparation, self-engagement, the diversity of the pool, and the expressed need for professional development. With  respect to teaching experience, only six of the respondents were full-time tutors, a few had no previous teaching experience, and those with experience generally had not taught adults. In the area of degree preparation, seven of the respondents had degrees in English, which does not guarantee experience in teaching the writing process; and some had only degrees in related fields, such as speech or education. Only four of the respondents were actively engaged in some kind of advanced degree program, and three of those degrees were related to language learning and literature. The diversity of the pool presented a problem in that most of the instructors were white, whereas the student population was predominantly Black, Hispanic, and Asian. Thus, a problem existed in the cultural definitions  which the part-time instructors brought to the classroom. Finally, a discrepancy was found between expressed needs for professional development and programs offered by CCC. In an effort to alleviate these problems, the college has developed Sustaining Academic Literacy, a professional development program consisting of six sessions, spread out over two quarters. It is intended to give part-time teachers a clear overview of the English curriculum and to identify and respond to their concerns. (JMC)",

        "author":["Moreno, Gilbert R."],
        "description":"California's 50% law requires that at least half of a community college district's expenditures per fiscal year be spent on instructional costs. These costs include the salaries of certificated instructors, salaries of such classified instructional personnel as aides and assistants, and employee benefits. A district's general expenditures include salaries of certificated and classified noninstructional personnel, employee benefits for these two groups, books and materials, contracted services, and equipment replacement. Funds from lottery revenues and expenses incurred from the leasing of the plant and equipment, the leasing of computers, and instructional agreements may be excluded from the total expenditures to help districts meet the 50% requirement. In 1987, a study was  undertaken to identify new approaches to meeting the requirement; to determine the fiscal impact of any new approaches; to compare the methodology of these approaches with guidelines set forth in the California Education Code (CEC); and to identify factors that significantly affect compliance with the 50% law. Selected findings include the following: (1) most of the 39 districts that spent under 52% of their funds on instructional costs in fiscal year 1985-86 would not have met the minimum 50% requirement without the utilization of exclusions; (2) inconsistent accounting practices have developed over the years, which combined with the uniqueness and magnitude of the newly introduced lottery revenues, have resulted in a loss of consistency and comparability in the 50% law; and (3) some of  the factors that have the most influence on 50% law compliance are high or low faculty salary schedules, the percentage of faculty contract hours taught by part-time instructors, a centralized or decentralized district organization, and the use of non-public vocational training schools. Percentages of selected districts' instructional costs for 1985-1987 and excerpts from the CEC are appended. (JMC)",

During the 1987-88 academic year, 904 students expressed an interest in transferring; 41% of those students were &quot;transient&quot; students, or students who had completed less than 12 credits. Information is also provided on RCC students who participated in articulation programs with local colleges, including 13 students in a joint RCC/Wentworth College program and 15 in a University of Massachusetts, Boston nursing program. Next, a description is given of changes that took place in the Transfer Opportunity Program, including a shift in focus from all students  transferring credits to only students graduating from RCC. Finally, recommendations for improving the transfer process are provided, including the importance of making counseling services available to every student from the first semester on, and the need to reevaluate the criteria used to measure graduate success rates.

The description is organized around three flow charts corresponding to different stages in the program's development, and which are followed by more detailed explanations. The first flow chart deals with program planning and development from inception to implementation. In this stage, an initiator perceived the need for an honors program and saw that a formal start was made. Subsequent steps included the selection of a project director, attendance at a regional honors conference, the selection of an honors committee, the establishment of a timetable for program implementation, and the articulation of the program's philosophy and objectives. The institution then moved  at its own pace to smoothly and effectively assimilate the new honors programs to the existing curriculum. The second flow chart addresses the selection of faculty and students to participate in the program. Some factors considered in faculty selection were the instructors' enthusiasm for the subject matter, and the clarity of their course objectives, requirements and grading procedures. Honors student recruitment activities were developed to coincide with GCCC's marketing activities, and a battery of tests was chosen for honors applicants. The final flow chart presents the course design and sequence for GCCC honors students. After a mandatory, one-semester honors symposium, each participant must take at least one honors course from each of the following divisions: Psychology or Political  Science; Understanding Art, Freshman Chemistry, or Zoology; Literature; and one course in the student's major or a computer language.

The handbook's suggestions are based on the results of a 3-year collaborative study between the Center for Applied Linguistics and Fairfax (Virginia) County Public Schools which sought (1) to identify significant features in the responses of students who were identified by their teachers as \"successful communicators/responders\" during acadedmic verbal interaction, and (2) to translate these findings into teacher strategies that promote language and cognitive growth. The handbook focuses primarily  on the use of language by students and teachers during verbal review, the time during the lesson when the teacher asks questions about material previously taught. The handbook is organized into two major sections, each containing short \"capsules\" that summarize the research results and present suggestions for classroom use. Many of the suggestions include examples of dialogue between a student and a teacher. The first section presents some general ideas for structuring classroom interaction and outlines specific strategies for making classroom interaction expectations more explicit. The second section presents specific strategies for dealing with the special problems of LEP students. (JD)",

In the 1960s, Kellog Hunt published a series of articles that explored the relationship between SC and writing skills. Researchers, since the 1960's, have explored this relationship and have found that SC exercises contribute to accelerated syntactic growth. Research in SC thus far has focused on the remedial college-aged native speaker of English, and a point of debate concerns whether or not this research is generalizable to second language students. Both non-ESL and ESL-based studies on the effectiveness of SC in developing writing skills are discussed.  The overview of the research literature concludes that although the available research fails to take into account the accuracy with which students use SC skills, enough evidence has been collected to indicate that SC can be effective in helping both native-English-speaking and ESL students use more complex syntax.

        "description":"Three developments in the field of foreign language education seem to have particularly great potential for foreign language teaching and learning in the 1990s: (1) proficiency; (2) technology; and (3) authenticity (PTA). The first of these developments involves the language proficiency movement's debate over the establishment of a common metric by which foreign language experience and proficiency can be measured. The second development concerns technological advancements computers, satellite communications, fax phones, interactive video, CD-ROM, electronic networks, and artificial intelligence. The developments in technology, however, do not remove the element of human creativity in conceptualizing good research projects and instructional applications. This job is still the  teacher's responsibility. Properly used, the new technology can be a valuable adjunct to teaching. The third area of development in foreign language teaching, authenticity, involves the use of printed and electronic materials prepared by native speakers for native speakers. Even in the first week of classes, students can be asked to deal with these materials at a level appropriate to their language skills. Foreign language instruction can also provide information about the world. The use of authentic materials makes this task not only easy, but unavoidable. (DJD)",

        "description":"An overview of contemporary assessment practices often used with Latino students is provided, and it is maintained that these practices often overlook the influence of culture and linguistic proficiency on cognitive performance. A new approach, the Sentence Verification Technique (STV), is proposed as an alternative method to assess the linguistic proficiency of language minority populations. The STV, developed as a technique for measuring reading and listening comprehension, requires the student to develop one of four types of test sentences from each sentence appearing in a test passage. The four sentence types include: copying an original sentence, paraphrasing a sentence, changing the meaning of a sentence, and constructing a distractor sentence that is similar in vocabulary  and syntactic structure to the sentences in the passage but unrelated in meaning. The effective application of the STV in a transitional bilingual education program in Holyoke, Massachusetts, is described, and the future needs and directions of linguistic proficiency assessment of Latino students are discussed.

The program's goals emphasized the acquisition of communicative proficiency, in English and Spanish, for both native-English-speaking and native-Spanish-speaking students. Using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design, the evaluation investigated the effectiveness of the San Diego program on the academic achievement, in both Spanish and English, of 78 fluent-English-proficient students (FEPS) and limited-English-proficient students (LEPS) in grades 2 through 6. As expected, both groups of students demonstrated achievement gains in reading and math (on both Spanish- and English-language tests), and performed at or above national norms  in all subject areas by the end of elementary school. These findings are discussed in terms of their conceptual and evaluative significance, and with respect to ongoing debates in the scholarly and policy-making communities. 36 references.

The combination of academic leaders in search of revenue, industrialists looking for a competitive edge, and state and federal governments attempting to restore economic vitality has resulted in dramatic growth in industry-university liaisons. Questions remain about the impact of partnerships between business and higher education, both for participants and society. Topics of the monograph's eight sections are as follows: (1) the emergence of industry-university liaisons (i.e. historical patterns and the 1980s and the rise of such liaisons); (2) ideological and  political agendas (advocates, opponents, and moderates); (3) motivating factors (government, industry, and academe); (4) types of industry-university liaisons (participants, disciplines, and topologies); (5) operational issues (i.e. keys to successful implementation and operation); (6) compatibility with academic functions (evidence, missions, and evolution of the institution); (7) assessing the impact (initial considerations and criteria); and (8) lessons for academic, corporate, and government leaders (i.e. generic lessons and lessons for state and federal governments, industry, and academe).

This project, which was begun in April 1988, is not an attempt to evaluate classroom teachers, and participation is voluntary. Videotape cameras, which have been set to either oscillate left to right or remain stationary, have been placed in the classrooms of participating teachers. Researchers will be meeting with these teachers to interview them individually and collect their comments about different portions of the videotape data collected in their classrooms. In addition, an attempt will be made to confirm or dispute general impressions established by earlier studies using this procedure or a similar one. An appendix provides background materials including videotaping schedules, a diagram of the  placement of the videotape camera in the classroom, and an outline of the project. (14 references) (EW)",

The subjects were 160 students enrolled in a large city high school, 89 females and 71 males who represented five ethnic groups--White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian. The majority of subjects had prior computer coursework or other computer-related experience. A Computer Attribution Scale and a Computer Attitude Scale were developed to examine the use and study of computers in this population by modifying the Mathematics Attribution Scale of Fennema, Wolleat, and Pedro, and the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scale, respectively. Two separate path analyses were performed on the data in the current study, one model using the variable &quot;coursework&quot; and  the other using the variable &quot;proficiency&quot; as the sole endogenous variables. In both cases, eight attribute variables and four attitude variables served as precursor or exogenous variables. All calculations were completed using the SPSS-X Regression procedure. Findings indicated that both models showed redundancy, and two reduced models were developed through theory trimming; for the variable &quot;coursework,&quot; the reduced model showed an excellent fit to the data, but for the variable &quot;proficiency,&quot; three of the retained paths were positive and one path was negative. Two major conclusions of the study are that early exposure to computers should take place in a high success environment, and that it should stress both the enjoyment and utility that one may experience with computers. One table  and four figures are provided. (24 references) (CGD)",

The subjects for the study were 171 male and female students, representing 102 white and 69 minority students who were enrolled in a large city high school. The majority of these students had already completed computer coursework or had other previous computer experience. Two scales, the Computer Attitude Scale and Computer Attribution Scale, were developed from the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scale and the Mathematics Attribution Scale of Fennema, Wolleat, and Pedro, respectively, in order to examine the use and study of computers in this population. The primary focuses of this study--sex  and ethnic differences in computer attitudes and computer attributions--were investigated using the multivariate analysis of variance technique. Results indicated that: (1) while there were no ethnic group differences in high school students' attributions of success or failure in using computers, there were significant sex differences in computer attributions, with males attributing their successes in using computers to their own abilities, and females attributing their success to uncontrolled environmental factors; (2) all groups involved had fairly positive attitudes toward computers; (3) both sex and ethnic group differences existed in computer attitudes, with white students perceiving computers as more enjoyable and challenging than minority students, and male students and white  students tending to have a more positive attitude toward learning computer skills than female and minority students.

The following topics are discussed: (1) indicators of the pressure on higher education to adopt a less resistant approach to the use of technology; (2) the progress that has been made in the past few years in the use of educational technology; (3) reasons why there is so much resistance to technology usage in colleges and universities; and (4) requirements that must be met by the institutions if students are to become involved and comfortable in the process of learning about technology. A concluding statement argues that individuals as well as institutions must begin to concentrate on how best to incorporate the use of  technologies into the learning environment--and that once inculcated in the educational system, technology will not only alter our way of learning, but will change the society in which we live.

The survey instrument was mailed to 1,923 (out of a possible 3,487) schools to the attention of the 1,963 school librarians; the response rate was approximately 67% (1,336). This report on the findings of the survey provides an in-depth picture of the status of school library media programs, including: (1) a profile of the librarians who responded to the survey (position, highest education level, certification level, years of experience, service on committees); (2) data on the status of the library media programs and policies (existence of written policies, resource sharing, audiovisual equipment, cataloging and  classifying systems); (3) information about the library media curriculum and its delivery (responsibilities of school librarians, the status of school library procedures and policies, and curriculum analysis); and (4) resource data (size of collection, daily circulation, budget for resources and supplies, library hours, noncurricular uses of the media center). The study attempted to present the data without drawing conclusions, but in some instances some rationale for the findings is presented. Nine appendixes include the regulations of the state board of education; three basic education circulars (1-83, 27-75, and 11-78); a memo about materials selection policies; instructional, supervisory, and administrative certificates; a guide to the new copyright law (educational use); the Public  School Code of 1949; and a copy of the questionnaire with results by both percentages and frequencies.

These goals were met by means of the following activities: a survey that gathered information about the status of disaster preparedness and alerted librarians to the need for emergency readiness; the provision of workshops throughout the state to train librarians in disaster preparedness and response; and the dissemination of information to the participants about who attended, available resources, and the role of the Division of Library and Information Services of the Florida  Department of State in the event of an accident or emergency. The survey questionnaire was designed to elicit information about collection maintenance and protection problems, conservation expertise available in each library, receptiveness to working in a network mode, and willingness to participate in a program to prepare disaster plans. This report describes the survey methodology; analyzes the responses received from 78 academic (96.3%) and 105 public libraries (90.4%); describes the 2-day workshops held in several areas of the state; and reports on post-workshop activities. The report concludes with an assessment of the project workshops and recommendations for materials, specialized equipment, supplies and emergency assistance procedures, communications, and a follow-up survey of  progress made by workshop participants.

It is suggested that these objectives correspond very well to the stages of training a new cataloger, with each stage building on the skills learned  in the previous stage. Filing in the public catalog was also learned during this first year training process. It is concluded that, although original cataloging can seem like a very difficult skill to master at the beginning of the training period, after the sequence of training steps has been completed original cataloging seems like a naturally acquired skill.

It is noted that academic libraries are full of controversial materials, and that this is necessary if the library is to be able to make information available that presents more than one point of view on issues. On controversial issues in society, it is argued, access to information on both sides of an issue should be the rule and not the exception. Balance should be the guiding principle in library collection development, and it is suggested that representing both sides of controversial issues in a collection is a powerful rationale for the  library's educational role on campus. It is concluded that the library should not be a reactionary presence when controversy arises, but a proactive and educating part of the education community. (EW)",

Job sharing is described as the division of one full-time job between two or more people, who voluntarily work part-time and share the responsibilities and benefits of one full-time job. Queries to job sharers and their library directors measured job sharing by focusing on such factors as reasons for job sharing, characteristics of the shared job, and the overall effectiveness of job sharing as perceived by the job sharers and library administrators. The survey showed that both employers and employees are  overwhelmingly in favor of job sharing, although both advantages and disadvantages are identified. In particular, the importance of communication was stressed, and the need for additional time to be spent on both supervision and evaluation was noted. (EW)",

The end goal of this research is to capture these relationships in structured representations of abstracts' contents so that users can require not only that the concepts of interest to them co-occur in the retrieved documents, but also that the roles they play in relation to one another are the ones of interest. Four tasks found useful in revealing other schema were performed by expert abstractors. The results were analyzed and used as the basis for developing a frame-like structure of abstracts reporting on empirical work. A discourse linguistic analysis of a sample of 276 abstracts identified  the lexical/syntactic clues which could be used by a system to automatically instantiate the frame-like structure of individual abstracts.

        "description":"A pilot study was conducted to evaluate selected NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) scientific and technical information (STI) products. The study, which utilized survey research in the form of a self-administered mail questionnaire, had a two-fold purpose--to gather baseline data on the use and perceived usefulness of selected NASA STI products by aeronautical engineers and scientists and to develop/validate questions that could be used in a future study on the role of the U.S. government technical report in aeronautics. The study population comprised 2,000 randomly selected members of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) with academic, government, or industrial affiliations in the United States; 353 usable questionnaires were received  by the cutoff date. The results showed: (1) the surveyed engineers and scientists are ardent consumers of STI, with the highest use rate for NASA technical reports (77.6%), followed by NASA-authored journal articles (68.7%) and NASA-authored conference/meeting papers (66.6%); (2) of the engineers and scientists who attended NASA-sponsored conferences and meetings (51.6%), 90% indicated that these conferences/meetings are important sources of information; (3) overall, the use rate for the NASA announcement and current awareness media is low, but those engineers and scientists familiar with them find these materials to be easy to use, current, and to have adequate scope and coverage; (4) over three fourths of those surveyed obtained NASA technical reports from their libraries and used these  reports for research purposes; and (5) the surveyed engineers and scientists judged the NASA STI products to be of good quality, with the technical reports judged to have very good format/organization and adequacy and accuracy of both data and visual presentation. The text is supplemented by 50 tables and four appendixes, including copies of the survey instrument and data. (21 references) (EW)",

Four methods of data gathering were used: (1) site visits with the seven regional systems, with one or more of the major resource libraries in each region, and with the ILL service of the Colorado Resource Center (CRC); (2) ILL statistics complied from various existing reports from the regional system, from the CRC, from individual libraries, and from OCLC; (3) a survey distributed to a representative sample of libraries participating in ILL; and  (4) a lending cost study executed by major resource libraries. From the results of analyses of all these data, 38 recommendations were developed. The report contains descriptions of the site visits, which provide a comprehensive and detailed picture of the resource sharing system and the CRC; the survey results, which show that ILL and other resource sharing activities are a vital part of library service in Colorado; an ILL lending cost study which provides a realistic, statewide determination of the cost of interlibrary lending; ILL loan statistics, which indicate the importance of ILL in meeting the information needs of state residents; a glossary and program description; and a two-part bibliography.

The bill provides for the establishment in the Department of Commerce of a Technology Administration, which would include the National Bureau of Standards, the National Technical Information [Corporation] Service, and a policy analysis office to be known as the Office of Technology Policy. It is noted that, while there is agreement generally on the kinds of new powers the agency would need to deliver its products and services on a more cost-effective basis,  there is disagreement over the need, or appropriateness, of setting up a government corporation to carry out these duties. In addition to the text of H.R. 4417, this report includes testimony from: (1) Barry Beringer, Associate Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, Department of Commerce; (2) George Brown, Jr., a Representative in Congress from California; (3) Joseph Clark, Deputy Director, National Technical Information Service; (4) Eric Leber, executive officer, Council of Scientific Presidents; (5) Harold Seidman, member, Standing Panel on Executive Organization and Management, National Academy of Public Administration; and (6) Doug Walgren, a Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania, who presents a case against the privatization of the agency.

The report contains an overview of the current status of literacy services in libraries based on a literature review (chapter 1); descriptions of the methodology and results of the library surveys, which sought information on the involvement of each type of library in literacy education (chapters 2-6); and eight case studies of model programs (chapter 7). Eight observations based  on the findings of the surveys and the case studies conclude the report: (1) library involvement in literacy varies greatly; (2) illiteracy will not be acted on if it is not seen; (3) literacy activities fit into a constellation of library services; (4) library literacy activities fit into a context of community service; (5) literacy services may not be institutionalized in the library; (6) volunteers are key personnel; (7) evaluation is a critical area for development; and (8) libraries are finding their place in the literacy effort. Four appendixes contain a 151-item bibliography of the literature on libraries and literacy education; a list of project references; survey cover letters and questionnaires; and a site visit interview schedule.

        "description":"Drawing from a review of the literature and a survey of state directors of community college education nationwide, this report highlights innovative ideas and programs used by colleges and states to increase the number of minority faculty at community colleges. Introductory sections describe the purposes and methods of a 1988 study of minority faculty at two-year colleges, institutional and state efforts and long-range plans to recruit minority faculty, and cooperative relationships with graduate schools and professional associations. The next section reviews data on minority underrepresentation on college faculties across the nation, their concentration in lower-level and untenured positions, and wide variations among institutions and states. After a brief review of data on  minority participation and degree attainment in higher education, the report lists a number of short- and long-range strategies that have been implemented by individual colleges and states. A descriptive statement about each strategy and, where possible, the name and address of a contact person are provided. In addition, strategies recommended in the literature are cited. Concluding comments stress the need for leadership in affirmative action, and underscore the responsibilities of states, trustees, faculty, and colleges. The survey instrument is appended. (ALB)",

The project had four interrelated components: (1) a revision of BCC's mission statement to incorporate a new section on institutional values; (2) the Course Outline Review Project, which examined the purpose and expected educational results of individual courses; (3) the creation of 20 task forces to define expected outcomes for departmental units, such as the bookstore and library, and for associate degree and certificate programs; and (4) the formation of the Educational Planning Committee to recommend a college planning process and format for the resulting plan.  After its second year of operation, the project had developed a revised institutional mission statement; had updated the content of 250 courses and revised course outlines to present objectives in the form of expected outcomes; had initiated a program of annual surveys of students, faculty, and administrators to assess their perceptions of campus services; and was on its way to presenting the college president with a model and timetable for the development of an educational plan. Appendixes provide a copy of the revised BCC Mission Statement, forms used in the revision of course outlines, a list of task forces, recommendations of the associate in arts degree/honors task force, survey instruments, the timeline of the Educational Planning Committee, a report on a study of the effects of  remedial reading instruction on subsequent college-level course work, and a sample project newsletter.

        "description":"Healthcare technicians may receive their training in hospitals/clinics, community colleges/vocational-technical institutes, universities/medical schools, proprietary schools, secondary schools, or government institutions. Most allied health and nursing organizations also require continuing education for relicensure and certification; however, these courses usually do not lead to advanced degrees. Technicians desiring career growth beyond their job-entry level are often faced with three problems. First, because less than 35% of all technical program graduates are from universities/medical centers, their coursework may not transfer for university credit. Thus they are forced to start all over to complete bachelor's degree requirements. Second, many universities cater to the  full-time, traditional student, while most technicians need to continue to work while learning or updating skills. A third problem exists in the lack of pertinent programs. In response to the need in all fields for an academic bridge from technical education to baccalaureate degrees, the Advanced Technical Studies Division of the College of Technical Careers at Southern Illinois University developed a 2 + 2 program in which only 60 semester hours, as opposed to the more traditional 120 hours, are required to earn a bachelor's degree after the associate degree is earned. Students are required to take general education courses, core courses, and electives focusing on specific career goals such as aviation management, electronics management, or healthcare management. Many of these classes  are offered in the evenings or on weekends to accommodate the working student. (JMC)",

        "description":"Over the past 20 years, the Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) has undergone a substantial shift in the number of credit hours for which its students enroll. In 1969, the percentage of students who enrolled for three credit hours or less was 20%, and they generated 6% of the full-time student equivalent (FTSE) enrollment. At that time, students who enrolled for 12 credit hours or more represented almost 40% of the headcount and more than 65% of the FTSE. By the fall of 1987, 47% of MCCCD's students enrolled for three credit hours or less, and they generated almost 20% of the FTSE. Only 18.5% of the students took 12 credit hours or more, generating less than 42% of the FTSE. Nationwide, approximately 70% of community college students enrolled in 1970 attended full  time, while in 1987, 33% were full-time students. The main implications of the growing percentage of students attending part-time are the effect on funding, within the framework of a formula that assumes students attend full time, and the length of time needed by a part-time student to obtain an associate degree. Given demographic trends and MCCCD's efforts to accommodate adult students, it is likely that this trend toward part-time enrollments will continue. Tables showing credit hour distributions are appended. (JMC)",

Puente's goals are to reduce the number of Mexican American/Latino community college students who drop out of school and increase the number who transfer to four-year institutions. To meet these goals, the project trains English teachers and Mexican American counselors to work as teams in conducting one-year writing/counseling/mentoring programs for Mexican American/Latino students. Since Puente began at Chabot College in 1982, 18 other California community colleges have initiated Puente programs on their campuses and over 1,800 students have been served. The programs are monitored on a regular basis, and data are collected each year  on student enrollments, retention, and transfer. These data indicate that 83% of the students who enrolled in Puente successfully completed the developmental writing class; 72% of those who went on to take English 1A completed it; and a total of 134 Puente students transferred to a state or private university. The program's success can be attributed to the collaboration between English teachers and Mexican American counselors, research-based writing methods, culturally-based academic counseling, an exemplary training model with ongoing staff development, strong community-based support, and a working partnership among community groups, postsecondary institutions, philanthropic organizations, and corporations.

Following two years of pilot testing with five community college districts, statewide implementation of Phase I of MIS is slated to begin in July/August 1989. Several critical findings regarding data collection and reporting emerged from the pilot project, including the following: (1) the new reporting requirements will need to be introduced over a two-year period to allow for thorough testing and implementation of new data collection mechanisms; (2) the Chancellor's Office needs to take a more structured approach to the development of definitions for data elements and reporting requirements and the  clarification of the roles of various state agencies; and (3) additional staff are needed to ensure data accuracy, access, and use. Phase I will focus on gathering data on student outcomes, beginning with information on student demographics, course outcomes, program awards, financial aid, matriculation, faculty assignment, and related areas. Phase II will emphasize the collection of data on staff, courses, programs, and the utilization of student services. When fully implemented, Phase II should allow the Chancellor's Office to regulate affirmative action efforts on a continuing basis, and to meet state and federal reporting requirements. Phase III will be devoted to the collection and reporting of data on finance and facilities, with special attention paid to the automatic development of  budget and expenditures annual reports. Appendixes explain procedures for modifying the MIS &quot;Data Element Dictionary&quot; and developing reporting requirements, the policy on data access and report development, and allocations for MIS development by district.

Introductory material explains that the new minimum qualifications, which replace the previously required credentials, are discipline based. In one set of disciplines, the minimum requirement is either a master's degree in the appropriate discipline, a bachelor's degree in the appropriate discipline with a master's degree in a related discipline, or the equivalent. In a second set of disciplines, the master's degree is not generally expected or available. For these predominantly vocational disciplines, faculty are required to have either a bachelor's degree in the appropriate discipline and two  years of working experience, an associate degree and six years of experience, or the equivalent. The lists of disciplines are intended to be flexible and responsive to the changing curriculum and administrative needs of each district. It is assumed that local boards, administrators, and academic senates will develop their own hiring procedures and standards within the context of these minimum qualifications. The lists of disciplines are attached as adopted by the Academic Senate of the California Community Colleges. For the disciplines in which a master's degree is required, degree expectations are specified and &quot;related&quot; disciplines are defined. (ALB)",

In tracing the historical development of ACC and surrounding counties, the report looks at growth in population and enrollment, the expansion of facilities, and legislative actions that have affected ACC. Next, the report highlights college activities to enhance academic quality, including faculty forums and workshops, a survey investigating the academic organization of other community colleges, and the establishment of an instructional program review  committee and program advisory committees. The next section briefly describes features of institutional management at ACC, focusing on the roles of division chairpersons and lay advisory committees, policy and procedures manuals, student participation in governance, functional units within the college, the recent creation of a committee on planning, and a community charrette on the future of the college. The strategies used by ACC to achieve fiscal stability are reviewed, and ACC's mission statement is presented. Information is given on institutional governance, control, and affiliation; a profile is drawn of ACC's student body and changes in student characteristics; and a list of ACC's instructional program is presented. The report, in addition, discusses assumptions held by the college  concerning the stability of demographic and enrollment trends and the stability of financial resources, and opportunities for cooperation in the surrounding community.

        "description":"This paper discusses ways in which the innate act of \"telling\" can be used in teaching to strengthen the bond between teacher and student and enrich the process of learning. The paper offers an intuitive rationale for using \"telling\" as a teaching mode in the community college classroom and provides a formal explanation of \"telling\" based on the work of theorists in the fields of cognitive science and speech-act theory. Among these theorists are the Russian meta-linguist, M. M. Bakhtin; Jurgen Habermas, the founder of \"universal pragmatics\"; and Dan Sperber, who developed the general \"relevance\" theory of communication which suggests that, for communication to occur, the speaker must \"make manifest\" his/her intention to effect \"a change in the listener's cognitive environment\"  and that this show of intention (\"ostension\") is a precondition for meaningful exchange. After discussing the relationship between \"ostension\" and \"telling,\" the paper provides examples of performative teaching that took place in classrooms at Northampton Community College (Pennsylvania) between 1986 and 1988. Dialogues between students and teachers in speech/theater, economics, English literature, composition, and social science classrooms are used to illustrate acts of disclosure, active listening, restatement, and teaching within the context of interrogating learners. Concluding comments indicate that all acts of \"telling\" share the intention of reaching understanding and that from this common ground they diverge according to the demands of course content and mutual cognitive  environments.

        "description":"One of the themes frequently appearing in the literature on student retention is that a primary determinant of student persistence is the interaction between students and faculty. Research reveals that students' educational intentions, goal commitment, and integration into the social and academic environment of the college are also influential. Studies conducted at Burlington County College (BCC) in New Jersey have revealed a 45% attrition rate between fall 1977 and fall 1978 among full-time freshmen, and a 20% second-semester attrition rate among fall 1978 freshmen. Research concerning the objectives of dropouts and their reasons for withdrawal indicated that 30% of the respondents to a 1988 survey had enrolled to complete an associate degree and then transfer, while over 60%  indicated such primary goals as completing courses for transfer, personal interest, new job skills, or career change. Students' reasons for withdrawal were not related to circumstances over which the college had control. In an effort to develop a definition of persistence, the records of 438 graduates were studied to determine students' grade point average, degree received, full-/part-time status, transfer status, years taken to complete the degree, breaks in attendance, and initial academic status. Study findings included the following: (1) 36% of the graduates attended BCC full-time, 64% part-time, and 40% as transfer students; (2) full-time students took an average of 3 years to obtain a degree, while part-time students took an average of 9 years; and (3) 15% of the full-time students  and 17% of the part-time students stopped out for periods ranging from 1 to 16 years during their attendance.

        "author":["Forman, Marshall"],
        "description":"The origins of the faculty development movement in higher education can be traced to the mid-1970's, when low retirement rates were virtually eliminating career mobility for professors, and changes in student demographics, educational settings, and instructional methods required many faculty members to alter their usual teaching practices. Private foundations and the Federal Government began funding organized faculty development programs emphasizing instructional development and teaching improvement. In the early 1980's, reduced clerical support, reduced travel budgets, massive amounts of deferred maintenance, as well as a decrease of about 13% in faculty earning power, triggered the formulation of a new faculty development paradigm. This paradigm draws upon social-psychological  theories of adult socialization to provide more holistic development activities. The New Jersey Department of Higher Education, for example, has proposed a statewide initiative to strengthen college faculty through far-reaching efforts, including an Institute for Collegiate Teaching and Learning located on a state college campus. A case study of faculty development activities at Brookdale Community College (New Jersey) revealed four basic levels of activities: (1) formally organized activities, including a Faculty Development Committee and 21 sub-committees; (2) a Center for Educational Research; (3) contractual arrangements, such as the sabbatical; and (4) informal activities, such as workshops and seminars. The best approach to faculty development programs appears to be a multifaceted,  flexible one balancing individual and corporate activity. Teaching improvement programs should be handled with sensitivity, and faculty must feel the program to be their own, and not imposed upon them by an administration or outside agency. (JMC)",

        "author":["Greenhouse, Michael"],
        "description":"A prerequisite for learning is admitting simply that one \"does not know.\" In order to discover and truly \"know,\" one must have an open mind, suspend all preconceptions and assumptions, and be able to tolerate the ambiguity experienced when the line between formal subject matter and those assumptions begins to blur. Many community college students make sharp distinctions between their coursework and their lives outside of college. They have been led to believe that they possess no power or control in the classroom, and therefore often fail to take responsibility for their own learning. Encouraging students to take responsibility for their classroom experience requires faculty members to relinquish authority and open up a space for students to exercise their rights as learners.  Only after students recognize the presence of ambiguity in the teaching-learning process can active learning, or discovery, take place. Ambiguity in the classroom may cause anxiety for some students, especially among community college students who tend to have lower skill development and less self-confidence. Some may draw back from the risks involved in determining for themselves which of several interpretations carries more weight. But others will begin to experience new ideas, question their beliefs, take chances by speaking their minds, and, in so doing, will become stronger thinkers and learners. These reflections are offered in the context of one individual's personal account of his decision to become and remain a community college sociology teacher. (ALB)",

The paper reviews community college business students' responses to questions about business ethics and provides materials and suggestions for the development of an ethics module in an introductory business administration course. Workable definitions and principles of ethics, sources of ethics in religious doctrines, reasons for the lack of ethics in business, teaching objectives and techniques, types of unethical activities, the development of a code of ethics, competing forces that affect ethical standards, and guidelines for ethical behavior are considered.

        "description":"Although most instructors are solely responsible for the evaluation and grading of students, they rarely receive formalized training in test construction or other forms of evaluation. Evaluating highly motivated students in very small classes is a rather uncomplicated procedure; however, evaluating large classes in which students have a range of abilities, as is commom at community colleges, presents a more complex situation. Traditionally, teacher-made tests have consisted of essay questions, multiple-choice questions, or true and false questions, each of which has its advantages and drawbacks. To help faculty plan the evaluation procedures used in their courses, a testing center was established at Mercer County Community College (MCCC) in 1977. The center not only administers  some 69,000 examinations for various MCCC courses, but also provides the New Jersey College Basic Skills Placement Test, course equivalency testing, and credentialling examinations. A survey regarding the quality, variety and adaptability of student evaluation at the college, presented to selected MCCC faculty, revealed the following: (1) subjective, essay examinations were limited mostly to the humanities and social sciences; (2) faculty in the disciplines of English, history, psychology, and business did not believe that they tested students for specific skills; (3) on the average, instructors administered tests to students every fourth week; (4) reasons cited for lack of use of the testing center included the absence of proper equipment (e.g., pianos, typewriters, or easels), an  increased potential for cheating, and the inability for students to ask questions during exams; and (5) students were generally well informed regarding what is expected of them in preparation for evaluation.

        "description":"This paper describes Pennsylvania's Bucks County Community College's (BCCC's) current practices for recruiting better-prepared students as a preface to several suggestions for new approaches to improve the recruitment effort. Although a nationwide survey of young people indicated that 60% felt two-year institutions were on a par with four-year schools, most students attend community college because of the low cost, the open-door admissions policy, and the proximity to home or work. For students not necessarily concerned with these issues, BCCC's policy of recruitment has had only limited success. This policy currently includes publicity efforts, student visits to the campus, and academic programs such as the Advanced Placement Program and the High School Enrichment Program,  through which better-prepared high school students can take college classes for credit. Suggestions for improving BCCC's recruitment of these students include: (1) improving interaction with the high schools through personalized visits by the faculty or department-sponsored tours of the college; (2) offering an Honors Program in which outstanding students in all fields can undertake independent study for honors credit; (3) using BCCC students as liaisons to their former high schools; (4) establishing articulation agreements with four-year colleges and universities that would make transfer automatic, with all credits accepted, for the bearer of an associate degree with a reasonable grade point average; (5) improving the quality of incoming students through more stringent admissions  policies or a testing service which reports back to high schools to inform them of their students' level of preparation; and (6) sharing facilities, such as libraries and laboratories, with advanced high school students.

        "description":"Community colleges are beginning to recognize that honors programs have a place in a comprehensive curriculum. Community colleges often experience problems attracting status-conscious, middle-class students, unless the institutions can convince the students and their parents that community colleges offer first-rate and academically challenging curricula. Honors programs can help improve the image and recognition of the schools, while providing a challenge to talented and motivated students. Honors programs vary among community colleges in terms of format, eligibility requirements, and academic standards. Typical formats include the following: (1) special honors sections of introductory or general education courses, most often in the liberal arts; (2) prescribed and structured  honors curricula including several honors courses that all students must take; (3) core-oriented programs developed around a common theme and an interdisciplinary approach; (4) independent study; (5) regular courses in which enrolled honors students receive more challenging assignments, labs, and tests; and (6) comprehensive honors programs that encompass several of these approaches. Successful honors programs are generally characterized by mechanisms for recognizing the accomplishments of honors students; an enthusiastic, intellectually aware, and dedicated faculty; a program director committed to the program who has time for the administrative responsibilities that the position entails; and an advisory committee. Critics have argued that honors programs are inherently elitist, that they  divert funds from the financially needy remedial students to middle-class gifted students. They warn that honors courses will isolate most of the brighter students, and they raise questions of faculty selection. If a college does decide to offer an honors curriculum, it should not be with the primary purpose of increasing enrollment or changing the institutional image, but rather in order to strengthen the college's educational mission and enhance its quest for excellence.

The first section traces the emergence of concern among national policy makers about the quality of undergraduate education and examines state-level responses to these concerns. The next sections review the positions put forth by those who oppose and support assessment. Educators' concerns about threats to academic freedom, the expenditure of state funds for questionable returns, and the misuse of effectiveness measures are noted, as well as opposing views of the movement as a very positive trend. Three major  types of assessment programs are described: (1) those focusing on program improvement; (2) those ensuring that all graduates possess basic academic competencies; and (3) those intended to assist in budget decisions and accountability. Next, the COEP is explained. After providing background information, the paper enumerates COEP's major intended provisions, including a common statewide assessment of general intellectual skills; institutional assessment of general education outcomes; faculty assessment of students' learning; and an assessment of students' personal development and satisfaction. Final sections summarize interviews with three COEP administrators concerning funding, barriers to COEP implementation, perceived benefits, and the use of results; and with three community college  COEP directors, regarding the value of COEP, and their concerns about funding, the use of outcomes, and the extent of state involvement.

In addition to a review of the literature on applied linguistics and second-language learning/teaching, Phase 1 included a needs assessment component that gathered data from two- and four-year college students and faculty in California concerning student background and performance characteristics, instructional methods and activities, and course objectives and content. The Phase 1 report includes sections on the following topics: (1)  language problems of non-native English speakers and ESL courses offered; (2) the scope of all three phases of the project; (3) theories of language acquisition and language teaching; (4) the creative construction and skill-learning modules of second-language acquisition; (5) the design of a syllabus for an ESL course based on a communicative approach; and (6) the development of writing skills in ESL. The bulk of the report focuses on the methods and findings of the needs assessment. Findings are presented concerning the demographic characteristics of ESL students; the actual and expected performance of students in college-preparatory ESL courses; instructional methods, activities, and materials preferred by both students and teachers; problems related to motivation and environment; the  need for video-based instructional materials in college-preparatory ESL classes; student and teacher preferences for topics in video and course materials; and the objectives, materials, and syllabi of current ESL courses.

        "description":"Limited financial resources, declining enrollments, changes in student demographics, calls for accountability, and collective bargaining have signalled a profound change in the role of the community college president. The greatest change during the last 20 years is that the decision-making process, once exclusively the domain of the president, has evolved into a more democratic, participatory process. Trustees, students, and especially faculty have begun participating in decision-making. Shared authority and increasing government regulation mean that the president must now deal with state legislatures, finance committees, coordinating boards, and even local constituencies. One drawback of this is that the president's role has become increasingly political. The community college  president is still very much a leader, but a different kind of leader. Researchers have concluded that effective presidents, far from being autonomous and rigid decision-makers, are flexible, thoughtful, and strong visionaries. Collective bargaining is perhaps the most significant issue to affect community college leadership in the past 20 years, and literature on this subject has been almost unanimously negative. Claims have been made that unionism weakens administrative control, and that collective bargaining creates competition rather than cooperation between faculty and administrators. On the other hand, it is noted that a collective bargaining contract, which outlines the duties and responsibilities of faculty, can make faculty more accountable. Since it is unlikely that faculty will  yield its newfound role in governance, community college presidents must adapt to their new role as managers of the decision-making process. (ALB)",

They must also understand the evolution of the role of the president over the last 30 years, from \"manager\" or \"builder\" in the early years to the more recent position of \"motivator.\" There is little agreement in the literature on a definition of leadership; moreover, it has been suggested by some researchers that leaders can be more effective if they are able to shift styles according to the situation in which they find themselves. Often referred to as \"moderate leadership style,\" this ability to shift styles results in a flexibility community college presidents must have in order to lead a diverse institution and deal with broad constituencies. In  the 1950's and 1960's, presidents were seen as \"builders,\" or strong, authoritarian figures responsible for planning and developing the colleges. In the 1970's, presidents were forced to deal with financial crises, demands for shared governance, increasingly agitated faculties, and, most controversial of all, collective bargaining. The emphasis during this time was on accountability, cost-effectiveness, and productivity; the role of the community college president became that of \"manager.\" Today, however, there is recognition that good management is not enough. Effective community college presidents must be creative and charismatic and they must recognize the importance of exerting leadership in four key areas: (1) interpreting and communicating the college mission and goals; (2) creating  a climate that encourages people and groups to work with the college; (3) establishing systems of governance that enable colleges to operate efficiently and effectively; and (4) providing educational leadership.

Findings of the two-year effort include the following: (1) 18.7% of the fall semester 1988 headcount were first-time students, while 15.8% were transfer students; (2) first-time students, were typically younger and more likely to study full-time than transfer students; (3) PVCC transfer students perform about as well academically as students who started as freshmen at  the senior insitutions, earning a grade point average on the whole of 2.8; (4) 73.3% of the students who transferred to a senior institution after completing a two-year program rated the level of their academic preparation as either excellent or good; (5) between 70% and 85% of all graduates in occupational/technical programs found full-time employment in jobs related to their fields of study; (6) 5.5% of the employers of graduates from the 1984-85 and 1985-86 classes rated the occupational/ technical education at PVCC as excellent, while 71.2% rated it as good; (7) most PVCC faculty believed that general education objectives were clearly stated and appropriate to course goals and objectives; and (8) on the average, students enrolled in developmental writing courses made significant  progress, while those enrolled in developmental math courses nearly doubled their scores on assessment tests. A timetable for the continued implementation of the PVCC assessment plan is included in the report. (JMC)",

        "description":"This paper underscores the importance of increasing the number of minority faculty at community colleges, cites examples of programs currently being conducted to achieve this objective, and suggests actions to be taken by community leaders and educators. Section I reviews reasons for concern about achieving a significant presence of minority faculty on two-year college campuses and considers demographic and economic trends that make it imperative that educational opportunities for minorities be expanded. Section II examines the numbers, percentages, and positions of minority faculty employed in higher education, indicating that, in 1985, 90% of the full-time faculty were White, 4% were Black, 4% were Asian, 2% were Hispanic, and less than 1% were Native American. Section III  reviews statistics on the participation of minorities in higher education, indicating that between 1976 and 1986, there was an almost 5% decline in the percentage of Black youth and over a 6% decline in the percentage of Hispanic youth attending college. In section IV, components of a multi-faceted effort to increase the number of minority faculty are discussed. This section offers examples of programs illustrating short- and long-range strategies for colleges and states. Section V looks at the related roles of national, state, and community leaders; state governments; college trustees; college faculty; and the colleges themselves to increase the number of minorities on campus.

        "description":"Current census data make clear that California's poor are poorer today than they were 10 years ago. In particular, data indicate that single working women with children earn less than working, married women with children. Because California's state-subsidized day care system directs programs to enroll children on the waiting list who are from families of lowest income, it can be concluded that subsidized programs are serving poorer families than were enrolled in the late 1970s. Deeper poverty suggests that ancillary aspects of day care programs, such as meals, health and dental care, and support services for parents, have become increasingly important to children. Provision of such services makes increasing demands on staff time and program resources. The reduction in  availability of services from the federal and local governments complicates the problem. It is concluded that demands for child care services will remain high throughout California for the forseeable future, and that a significant part of the demand will be for either inexpensive or subsidized care. Facts that child care advocates should make clear to policy makers are pointed out. Objectives and activities of the Children's Roundtable Project of the California Children's Council are described and Roundtable participants are listed. (RH)",

Two questions were addressed: (1) Does instruction in art by a qualified art teacher produce increased learning of the content of art? and (2) Does art instruction emphasizing thinking skills have positive effects on student learning? Four major areas of instruction were addressed in the experimental art program: design concepts and expressive art production, critical and appreciative learning in art, cultural and historical aspects of art, and creative problem solving. Two teachers with certification in art education were assigned to the experimental schools. The teachers met with students in grades 1 through 6 for 1  hour each week. Lesson plans were designed to teach art concepts with an emphasis on higher level thinking skills. In addition to analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, students were involved in activities requiring transformation, causation, focus, visualization, tolerance, elaboration, and divergent thinking. The experimental group consisted of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students; the control group consisted of students receiving art instruction from regular classroom teachers. Results indicated that instruction in art by a qualified art teacher produces increased learning in the content of art. Findings concerning student achievement were inconclusive. (RH)",

Data were gathered through the observation of three experienced kindergarten teachers, one male and two female. Observations were subsequently related to ideas about professionalism from the literature on women and work and on professionalism in teaching. Findings indicated that home affected work and vice versa. Effects were both day-to-day and long-term, with long-term effects being more significant to the teachers. Findings suggested several conclusions about professionalism and the relation of home and work in early childhood education.  (RH)",

        "description":"In an effort to determine if achievement gains of low-achieving Chapter 1 students could be bettered, the Austin Independent School District implemented Chapter 1 Schoolwide Projects (SWP) in two schools to reduce class size to 15 pupils per teacher. SWP teachers functioned as regular classroom teachers with students of mixed achievement. Chapter 1 students received supplementary reading instruction from Chapter 1 teachers. Because 90-95% percent of SWP students were Hispanic, analyses were restricted to include Hispanic students only. Analyses used were a regression approach to analysis of covariance, with the pretest score as covariate. A series of regression models was constructed with the posttest as the dependent variable. A systematic series of model comparisons resulted in  discovery of the model which combined the best prediction of posttest scores with the fewest predictor vectors. The same comparisons have been made since 1980-81, the first year of the implementation of SWP in the district. Findings revealed few differences between SWP and regular Chapter 1, indicating that SWPs may be producing some reading achievement gains, but generally not significantly more than the less expensive Chapter 1 Program. Results are discussed in terms of achievement results, costs, findings from the literature, and political considerations. (RH)",

In 1985-86, the program consisted of full-day classes serving low-achieving and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in Chapter 1 schools. In 1986-87, the district implemented half-day classes in accordance with a state mandate, and served all low-income and LEP students in the district. In 1987-88, the district doubled the number of teachers, put full-day classes in Chapter 1 schools and half-day classes elsewhere; and began to serve low-income and LEP students as close to their attendance area as possible. In each of the three years, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised was given to all students or to a random sample of  students. In 1987-88, the Test de Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody was given to Hispanic LEP students who were Spanish monolingual. Summarized in the report are: (1) achievement results for similar students in full-day versus half-day programs; (2) achievement results for low-income and limited-English-proficient students; (3) comparisons of 1-year gains during the period; and (4) differences in attendance for the groups.

An examination of the history of the family reveals that the family of the past was very different from the idealized versions popularized in the media. Data concerning divorce, single-parent families, intergenerational interaction, out-of-wedlock births, teen pregnancy, and cohabitation indicate similarities and differences between the families of past and present. Several closely related and distinct myths about the American family affect social legislation and policy. Prevailing myths are those of the monolithic family form, the independent family, and parental determinism regarding child outcomes. To the extent that the schools' often inflexible structure does not  correspond to the diversity of families, schools support, reinforce, and perpetuate these myths. Most schools are still organized around the myths and accomodate the mythical family. Schools can change to meet the needs of the contemporary family by becoming aware of the constraints on the various family forms, and by increasing the involvement of parents, business, and social welfare agencies in the schools.

        "description":"A forced-choice observer-based testing procedure was used to determine pure-tone hearing thresholds for 2- to 4-week-old infants. Stimuli were 500-ms tone bursts of 500, 1,000, or 4,000 Hz with 500-ms intervals between tone bursts. Stimuli were presented monaurally by means of an insert earphone. Each 15-s trial consisted of 5 tone bursts, followed by a 5-s silent interval, followed by a 5-s test trial. During the test interval, either five tone bursts were presented, at the same intensity as in the first interval, or 5 s of silence were presented. An observer with no prior knowledge of trial type judged whether a sound had occurred during the test interval on the basis of the infant's behavior. Intensity varied between 25 and 70 dB SPL. For all infants at each frequency,  psychometric functions were fit to the proportion of correct judgments as a function of intensity by probit analysis. Threshold calculated from this function was 56 dB at 500 Hz and 41 dB at 4,000 Hz. Threshold could not be calculated at 1,000 Hz; the observer made 0.65 correct judgments at the lowest intensity used. Results, which agree with other recent reports, suggest that the function relating sensitivity to sound frequency is not adultlike at this early age. (Author/RH)",

Signal trials consisted of 500 ms tone bursts, with rise/fall time equal to 10 ms, and with 500 ms silent intervals between bursts in a 10 s pulse train. No-signal trials were also 10 s in duration, but no tone burst occurred. Probability of a no-signal trial equaled 0.25. Trials started when the baby was active at a criterion level for at least 10 s. Activity was measured as the variance of the instantaneous output of the monitoring device. The probability of increase or maintenance of pre-trial activity was significantly  higher on signal trials than on no-signal trials, especially for 0.5 and 4 kHz tone bursts. This effect may reflect a temporary sound-induced change in the infant's cyclic motility, and could afford a means for testing hearing in newborns. (Author)",

The masker intensity at which the pulsing probe becomes indistinguishable from a physically continuous probe is the PT. A measure of frequency resolution can be obtained by examining the effects of masker frequency on the PT. In the PT masking technique, two tone bursts were presented in alternation. As the intensity of the masker tone was increased, the probe began to sound continuously. Probe frequencies between 500 and 4,000 Hz were used. PTs were determined by randomly presenting signal trials in which a pulsating probe alternated with a pulsating masker of variable intensity or frequency; and no-signal trials, in which the probe was physically continuous  and the masker remained pulsating. A blind observer judged whether a signal or no-signal trial had been presented, based on the infant's behavior. Infant responses to signals were reinforced by the activation of a mechanical toy. Preliminary results suggest that masker frequency affects 6-month-olds' and adults' PTs in much the same way. Frequency resolution becomes progressively better at higher frequencies. (Author/RH)",

Results showed stability of activity level, orienting, and smiling from 6 weeks to 4 months of age, and a trend toward stability of soothability during this period. Stability was found for all measured temperament traits from 4 to 9 months. Orienting and soothability remained stable from 6 weeks to 9 months. Maternal and paternal perceptions of infant temperament were positively correlated for activity level, distress to limitations, distress to novel stimuli, and orienting. There was a trend toward significant positive correlations for infant smiling. Only in ratings of infant soothability were parents' assessments  not related. When infants were grouped as easy or difficult, there were no significant effects of 6-week or 4-month temperament on 9-month maternal attachment to the infant. However, mothers felt significantly less attached to 9-month-olds rated as difficult and fearful. Mothers were less attached to first-borns above the median in distress to limitations and later-borns below the median. No significant relations were found between easy and difficult infant temperament measured at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 9 months and quality of infant attachment to the mother 1 year after delivery.

Data from the New York Longitudinal Study (NYLS), originally collected by Thomas, Chess, and Birch (1963, 1968, 1977, 1983, 1984) was analyzed. The NYLS assessed children's personalities at home and school from infancy to young adulthood. Many expected results were not found. Regarding the prospective analyses, girls, rather than boys, showed more problematic behavior prior to parental separation. The effects of time also were not in accord with prior findings, as children's adjustment generally was not a function of the time since parental separation. With the exception of parental conflict, few child care  practices were consistent predictors of children's long-term adjustment. The interaction between temperament and parental conflict was not strong in predicting children's short- and long-term adjustment. Results highlight the predictive utility of parental conflict, suggest discrepancies with prior research, and demonstrate the value of the secondary analysis technique. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study assessed the impact of an explicit goal to remember and thematic organization on the strategic behavior and recall performance of preschoolers. A total of 41 subjects were instructed either to remember 12 items for later &quot;purchase&quot; at a play store or to play with them. The items for half the children in each condition were linked to a beach picnic theme, while the alternate array was comprised of familiar but unrelated objects. Children in the play condition spent considerable time physically engaged with the items, in contrast to children in the &quot;remember group&quot; who did not directly interact with the objects, but intermittently looked at and named them. Differences in the behaviors of the two groups and the nature of the behaviors of the children in the &quot;remember  group&quot; suggested that precursors of mnemonic strategies are available to preschoolers. However, only naming of items was predictive of recall. Item organization did not affect immediate recall scores. Only children exposed to the beach array maintained their level of recall after a 1-week delay interval. It is concluded that the data are compatible with the notion that schemas influence retrieval rather than encoding. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"An investigation was undertaken of the hypothesis that the parent-child interactions of children having an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would resemble those of rejected children and differ systematically from the interactions of popular and neglected children. Subjects were 12 popular, 12 neglected, and 12 rejected boys of differing sociometric status who ranged in age from 3 to 5 years. Additionally, 13 children ranging in age from 3 through 6 years who had been diagnosed as exhibiting ADHD were recruited. Physician's records indicated that the diagnosis of ADHD had been made on the basis of parent descriptions of the child. Data were gathered through teachers ratings on the Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire and the California Child Q-set for each  participating child, and videotapes of each parent playing separately with the child for 20 minutes. Videotapes were scored on the following behaviors: (1) parent direct and child direct; (2) parent suggest and child suggest; (3) parent question and child question; (4) physical play; (5) object play; (6) approach stimulation; (7) avoid stimulation; (8) overstimulation; (9) positive affective response; and (10) aggression. Findings indicated that, in general, although the parent-child interactions of the ADHD children tended to differ from all of the other groups, they tended to differ least from the interactions of rejected children.

Data were obtained through interviews of directors of state departments of education nationwide, interviews of two or more curriculum specialists in seven states judged to be particularly active in promoting higher order outcomes, and a review of curriculum-related documents cited during the interviews. Results indicated that state guidelines for curriculum reform were typically communicated through in-service programs, statements of goals and objectives, or guidelines for local curriculum planners. Reform initiatives rarely included statewide tests. Highlighted in the report are similarities and differences in policy initiatives of states actively promoting  curriculum reforms. California was the only state that had aggressively negotiated with publishers to develop books or other instructional materials that supported the state's call for curriculum reform.

        "description":"A series of studies investigated whether infants can detect cues in ongoing speech that could help them delineate those segments that correspond to grammatical units like phrases and words. The methodology of the study involved asking whether infants show a preference between speech samples in which pauses have been inserted coincident with the boundaries of the unit in question versus those in which pauses have been inserted at a location internal to the unit. Findings, overall, indicate that by the age of 4 and one-half months infants show a sensitivity to prosodic cues in speech that are correlated with speech segments that span clausal units in language, and this sensitivity obtains whether the language is English or whether it is an unfamiliar language, Polish. By about 6  months, this sensitivity has narrowed to English. But 6-month-olds do not appear to show a sensitivity to cues that are correlated with speech segments that correspond to finer linguistic units. Not until 9 months of age can infants detect cues that can mark segments corresponding to the clause-internal strucure formed by the major phrase constituents. Not until 11 months of age is there apparent sensitivity to cues that correlate with the packaging of syllable strings into unfamiliar words. Possible interpretations of the findings are discussed.

A total of 69 second graders were administered a revised verion of Furman and Buhrmester's (1985) Network of Relationships Inventory. Social competence was assessed sociometrically and with seven behavioral nominations. Findings indicated that the most consistent predictors of social competence were companionship and instrumental aid. Amount of time spent with mother was negatively related to indices of social competence. For boys, companionship with mother was predictive of disruptiveness. In contrast, aid from mother was positively related to indices of social competence. For boys, the more helpful the mother the fewer nominations they received as starting  fights, disruptive, and unhappy. For girls, mother's helpfulness was related to fewer nominations of shyness. If a child spends a great deal of time with mother, she or he may not acquire the social skills needed for interaction with peers. The positive relation of instrumental aid to social competence suggests that it may be more important for a child to feel that the mother is available when needed than to spend a great deal of time with her.

Although nearly half of the mothers could not rate approach and adaptability at 1 week, most could rate all temperament dimensions at 1 and 3 months.

The report uses the Child Caring Reportcard to compare the workings of the child care system in each county. Counties are  ranked on nine indicators that measure the quality and diversity of child care, and the extent to which child care services are accessible to children regardless of income. While complete statistics are not available, the report contains all information that is available on each county. Appendix A offers recommendations to various agencies concerning the collection of much of the missing information.

        "description":"Three studies examined the abstractness of children's mental representation of counting, and their understanding of the cardinality principle, namely, that the last number word used in a count tells how many items there are. In the first experiment, 24 toddlers of 2-3 years counted objects, actions, and sounds. Findings revealed that children counted objects best; most were also able to count actions and sounds. This finding suggests that at a very young age, children begin to develop an abstract mental representation of the counting routine. When asked, &quot;How many?&quot; after counting, only older children gave the last number word used in the count a majority of the time. This suggests that children younger than 3.5 years do not understand the cardinality principle. In the second  experiment, children were asked to give a puppet 1 through 6 items from a pile. Older children succeeded at this task. They spontaneously counted how many items they gave, thus showing a clear understanding of the cardinality principle. Younger children succeeded only at giving 1, and sometimes 2, items, and never spontaneously counted. In experiment 3, 18 toddlers were asked several times for 1 through 6 items. Results indicate that children learn the meanings of smaller number words before larger ones within their counting range up to number 3 or 4. (RH)",

Assessments included interviews with children, teachers, and parents, a review of school records, and direct observation of children. Findings indicated that attachment  classification in infancy is one of the strongest risk factors in the data set.

They also are more concerned as leaders about task completion and less about school climate and individual needs. It was also found that there were no substantial differences between male and female rural principals, either experienced or inexperienced, in their general activities or  leadership style. Great Plains rural principals perceive themselves in one manner, but they often act in another manner. Several possibilities account for this discrepancy, but time, teaching assignments, and the multitude of administrative duties are the most likely causes. If the perception of instructional leadership is ever to become reality, rural principals must be provided more opportunities to become effective leaders. (TES)",

It also lists the causes of turnover as reported by short-term superintendents. This study finds that turnover is higher in the subject rural districts than the national average. Superintendents report that they leave these rural positions for personal family reasons, because of the particular nature of the rural position, because of conflict with rural boards of education, and for career advancement. While the study did not empirically compare its rural districts and superintendents with other districts and superintendents, there is reason to expect unique differences in rural areas. This paper calls for more information about superintendent turnover and its  causes. (Author/TES)",

        "author":["Theobald, Paul"],
        "description":"A relationship exists between agrarian thought and the practice of formal schooling in the rural Midwest. Three traditions have shaped agrarian thinking about democracy and its application to social institutions, especially education. Fundamentalism, localism, and pastoralism have combined to form the ideological base for rural resistance to educational reform exhibited by rural boards of education throughout the history of the Middle West. The development of these traditions can be viewed in four time periods. In colonial times, the Puritans influenced the development of fundamentalism, which was transported to the Midwest. The period between the Revolution and the Civil War marked the development of localism. The years between 1865 and 1920 saw the development of the pastoral  ideal in agrarian thinking. After 1920, the traditions were slowly eroded, accompanied by steady rural population decline. All three theories took hold in the Midwest and continue to work in opposition to district consolidation, higher teacher salaries, and other contemporary educational reforms. Agrarian communities have encouraged simplicity and a conscientious consumer ethic, often manifesting itself in the kind of books, equipment, school buildings, and opportunities offered to district schoolchildren. Mass media, agricultural mechanization, and migration to urban areas have somewhat lessened the impact of agrarianism and consequently there has been more and more rural district consolidation and school change. It is no coincidence that in states least affected by the spread of  industrialism, such as the Dakotas and Nebraska, rural resistance to centralization of education remains quite vocal.

        "description":"In the school year 1988-89 the school district of the city of Saginaw operated two programs designed to meet the special needs of bilingual and migrant students: (1) the Section 41, State Bilingual Education Program; and (2) the ECIA, Chapter 1, Migrant Education Program. Both programs operated at 21 elementary schools, 5 junior highs, and 2 high schools. The Bilingual Program served 901 K-12 students, while the Migrant Program served 494 students, K-12. The State Bilingual Program served students whose primary language was other than English, or who came from a non-English speaking home environment. The Migrant Education Program served students whose families follow the crops or fishing industry and as a result the students experienced educational discontinuity. Although the  programs' philosophies differ, the student populations overlap, because, in most circumstances, a student in the Migrant Program comes from a non-English speaking home. In view of this fact, the two programs cooperate by sharing the same staff, materials, and activities. This report presents the programs' evaluations for the 1988-89 school year. Evaluation procedures included: (1) structured interviews with advisors at their support service sites; (2) structured interviews with teachers at their instructional sites; and (3) classroom observations. The results were summarized into statements indicating one of the following: a program strength; a potential strength; or a weakness. Appendices include: (1) description of identification and eligibility procedures; (2) samples of interview and  observation forms; (3) item analysis of the interviews; and (4) lesson elements checklist results.

        "description":"The Appalachian &quot;Tale of Red Emmy&quot; presented in the novel &quot;Oral History&quot; by Lee Smith (1983), reveals both an Irish origin and an American transformation. Granny Younger, one of Smith's narrators, tells of a curse visited on four generations of the Cantrell family after Almarine Cantrell chanced upon the witch Red Emmy in the wilds of the Appalachian Mountains, lay with her, and rejected her because she was a witch. Irish or Celtic motifs found in the tale include the journey to an Otherworld; a bird as guide on the journey; fairy-like characteristics of Red Emmy; a body of water with a girl bathing; a color scheme of red, white, and black in the witch's (fairy's) description; Red Emmy's disappearance when Almarine looks away; Almarine's bewitched lovesickness; the witch  overpowered by the sign of the cross; the curse of a scorned witch (fairy); connections between the witch and lower animals; and Almarine's resemblance to the Irish folk hero Finn Machumail. American influences are seen in the tale's setting, Granny's statement that this a &quot;true&quot; story, and Red Emmy's intimacy with the Devil. Although written by a modern Appalachian novelist trying to capture the essence of Appalachian people 80 years ago, this tale blends ancient Irish traditions with distinctly American traits. Of Scotch-Irish ancestry, Lee Smith herself was unaware of the Irishness of this tale. This paper includes Smith's responses to a questionnaire on her cultural background and education. (SV)",

Teaching cases play an important role in preparing teachers emotionally as well as intellectually for the problems of multicultural classrooms, and in legitimizing the discussion of crucial educational factors, such as teacher personality, that the positivistic research tradition ignores. &quot;Malaise of the Spirit,&quot; a case about a teacher's response to the demoralization in a racially divided Alaskan high school, illustrates the way a case can give novices: (1) vicarious experience with the kinds of problematic situations characteristic of teaching; (2) a model of how an expert teacher frames and constructs educational problems;  (3) a model of how a sophisticated teacher inquires about and reflects on such problems; (4) a stock of educational strategies for use in analogous problem situations; and (5) a sense that teaching is an inherently ambiguous activity requiring continuous reflection. This paper describes (1) the issues in the exemplary case; (2) the Teachers for Alaska program, which uses such cases to prepare teachers for small high schools in remote Native villages; (3) how the cases were written; and (4) how classes based on cases are conducted.

        "description":"This paper investigates the paid employment of mid-nineteenth century women, especially female heads of households, in two West Virginia cities. During this period, Wheeling was a large industrial city and major transportation center, while Morgantown was an isolated college town. An examination of census entries and city directories for Wheeling and Morgantown from 1840 to 1880 reveals that women had limited opportunities for paid employment. The vast majority of women followed occupations that capitalized on their traditional domestic and nurturing skills. Even when they moved into retail shops, they usually did so in areas related to cooking and sewing. Women in unusual occupations often appeared to have inherited their husbands' businesses. While Wheeling listed a number of  women as teachers, particularly during the Civil War, this field seems to have been closed to women in Morgantown. Employment opportunities for women apparently expanded during the Civil War, only to diminish again by 1870. Women without skills or funds were relegated to the hard low-wage jobs of seamstress or washerwoman, or, if they wanted more money, they became prostitutes. In general, though, women worked in a pre-industrial economy, even when they lived in a heavily industrialized city such as Wheeling. This paper contains 36 endnotes. (SV)",

        "description":"Family solidarity runs strong in Appalachia, where young adults typically settle near their parents in kin-based rural neighborhoods. One child rearing practice that may contribute to this closeness is parent-child co-sleeping. Interviews with 107 mothers in eastern Kentucky focused on the sleeping location history of one child. Most subjects were working-class housewives with high school educations, living in nuclear family households of two adults and two children. The children had a mean age of 5.6 years, with a range of 2 months to 22 years. First sleeping location was the parents' bed for 36% of the children and different bed in parents' room for an additional 48%. At the time of the interview, 36% of the children were sleeping in parents' bed or room, 23% were with  siblings, and 41% had their own rooms. The oldest child reported to co-sleep with a parent was 8 years old and was in transition to sleeping with a sibling. Variations in the overall pattern of children's sleeping locations were related to the child's birth order, number of rooms in the house, mother's place of birth (Appalachia versus elsewhere), and mother's and father's educational attainment. Mothers were more likely to have negative feelings about moving their child's sleeping location to another room if the move was sparked by a sense of &quot;appropriate&quot; behavior than if it was motivated by situational or demographic factors.

The project's approach to staff development assumes that change in school reading programs proceeds via extensive reconceptualization by administrators and teachers. New concepts involve the teaching of reading as thinking; teaching reading in content areas; integrating reading, writing, and thinking throughout learning phases; and strategic reading and teaching. Participants are leadership teams (typically an elementary school principal, library-media specialist, and reading specialist or teacher) from 18 small Wisconsin school districts. Teams view  in-service education programs in their schools on broadcast public television. Via narrowcast FM public radio and telephone conferencing, the project staff helps participants to use the programming to reflect on their own views of reading and in their daily classroom practices. Participants use telephone conferencing and electronic mail to share their reflections and thereby create a common working language. Evaluation of the project's first year (1987-88) documented changes in reading instruction by some participant teachers and reading specialists, accompanied by the use of new language to talk about reading as a thinking process.

The goals were (1) to improve the educational experience of students so that each student may reach his or her full potential; (2) to define and identify &quot;at risk&quot; students and develop and support preventative and remedial strategies; (3) to develop and recommend implementation of a system to assure greater accountability for success in the public school experience; (4) to strive to improve the skills of  teachers, school administrators, and education support personnel in their professional growth and development; (5) to examine and propose incentives and alternatives to promote greater efficiency in the administration of school districts; (6) to develop an action agenda to increase support of public education by participating in an education coalition; and (7) to define, develop, and support the programs of the Department of Education. This annual report describes activities of the Department of Education and various districts, schools, and supplemental programs such as museums and libraries that were undertaken to meet these goals.

The institute is a state-funded cooperative effort between school districts and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. It provides tuition-free spring and summer workshops for rural teachers in science, math, and language arts. The focus of each Renewal Institute teaching program is determined by a steering committee of local teachers, administrators, and university faculty. The institute's summer 1987 language arts program is described with particular emphasis on the cooperative aspect of the program and the high degree of teacher involvement. Obstacles and incentives for teachers to implement workshop ideas are also described and  discussed in detail. Among the factors influencing change in the classroom are: money, administrators, colleagues, parents, students, and professional self-improvement. The paper concludes that rural teachers and teaching positions differ from their urban and suburban counterparts in several aspects, both positive and negative. Rural staff development programs lack some incentives often associated with effective change in larger schools, including external pressure to try new approaches, organizational structures conducive to change, and ongoing technical and resource support. The close-knit quality of rural schools, on the other hand, provides a different set of advantages that can be used by staff developers. Contains 14 references. (TES)",

Rural problems include sparsity of population, motivating minority students toward higher achievement, and meeting the needs of special populations: the handicapped, the gifted, and juvenile offenders. Alternatives examined include setting up free universities in small communities, bilingual and multicultural education programs, rural outdoor education programs, multi-media General Equivalency Diploma  (GED) preparation, and home schooling. Generally, the people who create innovative programs are community leaders and parents. Well defined needs, self-starting learners, and cooperation among educational units characterize successful alternative programs. The most important characteristic, however, is that programs be community-based, born of necessity rather than technological expediency. Contains 10 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"This digest provides a history of American bilingual education in Spanish from the late 1950's onward, to help educators serve Mexican American students. From 1958 to 1968 curriculum reforms influenced by the launch of Sputnik combined with an influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Cuba to effect development of bilingual programs in south Florida public schools; such programs were copied in other areas. Successful programs in Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and California led to increased federal interest culminating in pasage, in 1968, of the Title VII Bilingual Education Act. The 1974 Supreme Court decision, Lau v. Nichols, held that school programs conducted exclusively in English denied equal access to education to students who spoke other languages. In 1982, amendment of  Title VII legislation gave school districts more flexibility in implementing bilingual programs and offered Title VII projects the option of using English exclusively. Criticism of bilingual programs mounted in the 1980s, however, accompanied by a movement seeking to make English the official language of the nation. This digest suggests that schools must continue to confront the problem of non-English-speaking students in some constructive way. Contains 9 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"This digest reviews the promise and drawbacks of computerized learning programs and telecommunication technologies for small rural schools. A critical feature of programmed learning packages can be their stand-alone feature. To the extent that such programs do not require the presence or involvement of a trained on-site teacher, they make it relatively easy to enlarge curricular offerings in small rural schools. Discussion also considers two-way interactive instructional television programs which make it possible to join geographically separated students and teachers. This digest describes an ideal situation in which teachers trained as generalists, managers of instructional resources, use stand-alone computer and television programs to provide detailed subject matter expertise.  Realization of this ideal hinges on the ability of the teachers and the quality and nature of their training. Thus, substantial changes would have to occur in how teachers in small rural schools are trained. It is concluded that, although the potential to solve small rural schools' curriculum problems is evident, questions about teacher training and development of instructional programs that substitute for on-site teacher expertise remain.

In the field of cultural journalism, the traditional skills and values of many different groups are chronicled, defined, for example, by ethnic origin, origin, occupation, or environment. The term &quot;cultural journalism&quot; was first used to describe publications inspired by &quot;Foxfire,&quot; a quarterly magazine produced by high school students in rural Georgia. Producing a publicatin such s &quot;Foxfire&quot; teaches not only language arts, but also photography, design, cultural heritage, and business management. The digest examines the forms cultural journalism can take such as courses, magazines, newspapers, or anthologies, as well as videos, tapes, records, and radio and television  productions. The scope of cultural journalism is broad, involving students from grade 4 up, many audiences, and subjects from individual family histories to studies of entire states or national groups. Producing such a project provides a practical, tangible reason for students to do academic work. It is concluded that cultural journalism can nurture the mutual appreciation of schools and communities, creating understanding that bridges different ages and cultures. Contains 12 references.

        "description":"The traditional relationships between rural and urban areas and the changes brought on by specialized rural industries discussed. The digest reviews work that has investigated the impact of farming, manufacturing, and mining on education. The effect of agricultural activity on academic achievement, especially via vocational agriculture programs, has attracted considerable interest. At least one study (Hobbs, 1987) credits vocational agriculture with developing leadership and entrepreneurial skills among students, suggesting a positive effect of a farming economy on school outcomes. Researchers also report that agriculture offers students the opportunity for part-time work, which seems to have a positive effect on grades (Charner &amp; Fraser, 1988). Part-time farming jobs do not,  however, appear to influence students' educational aspirations. The farm crisis of the 1980's may bring significant economic changes in agriculture and subsequent effects on school outcomes. Studies of the Relationship between the growth of manufacturing and school outcomes show mixed results, with at least one study (Rosenfeld, Bergman, &amp; Rubin, 1985) associating a net loss in manufacturing jobs with an increase in educational attainment (years in school). The evidence, however, is hardly conclusive. Studies of student achievement in mining-dependent counties in Appalachia show significant differences between Appalachian and non-Appalachian areas. Although more study is needed, data (Bagby et al., 1985; DeYoung, 1985) suggest that mining economies exert a negative influence on student  achievement. It is suggested that more study is necessary to better understand the relationships between education and economic development. This digest includes 10 references. (TES)",

        "description":"This ERIC digest synthesizes research characterizing the economic climate in which rural schools operate and reports on the traditional strategies used to create greater economic support for rural school districts. The benefits of steady urban economic growth have not been shared, generally, by rural areas; this has led to inadequate financial support for rural schools. While state aid may come via foundation programs, rural disparities have been most consistently reduced in states that adopted power equalization programs that guarantee minimum revenues (Jess, 1980). Federal funds help lessen rural discrepancies, but do not close the gap (Orland, 1988). Further, state and federal contributions often are tied to programs that may be difficult for rural districts to implement.  Rural schools have been faulted for inefficiency because their per-pupil expenditures were viewed as being too high, leading to the emerging view that rural and small schools are inherently more expensive. To fund and preserve rural schools, some observers have proposed a typology that accounts for diversity among all school districts (Augenblick &amp; Nachtigal, 1985). It is suggested that government equalization initiatives fail because their mandates impose burdens that are out of scale to their benefits. Many educators overcome rural disparity by addressing the social context within which rural schools operate. The common theme in these approaches is that it is impossible for rural schools to deliver the same services in the same ways as other schools, since the economic support and  community will necessary to meet expectations may not exist.

        "description":"This ERIC Digest discusses relevant issues and alternatives for rural school districts trying to develop strong programs for their most academically talented students. Although rural schools are more often constrained by high costs and material shortages than are urban schools, there are opportunities inherent in the lower teacher-student ratios and higher student involvement typical of small rural schools (Nachtigal, 1982). Programs for gifted students should address substantive academic goals, including: (1) bringing students' achievement closer to full potential; (2) ensuring that gifted students in outlying schools are identified and have access to appropriate services; and (3) improving access to advanced courses for talented high school students. Implementing rural gifted  programs requires sensitive work with parents, other rural teachers and administrators, and with institutions other than the school district. A stable staff is necessary to assure rural parents and administrators that gifted programs are important and necessary (Howley, Howley, &amp; Pendarvis, 1986). While rural schools often lack resources needed for comprehensive gifted programs, program development is probably best expanded from an academic/acceleration model over a period of time (Howley, 1986). For elementary students, acceleration can be accomplished within the school through a wide variety of means. Networking with colleagues in a variety of settings can open up new opportunities for teachers and administrators to share resources, develop programs, and improve service delivery.  Curriculum can be improved by linking with colleges, laboratories, or performing arts programs through electronic media, computers, and telecommunications networks. This digest offers several resource ideas for rural educators. It contains 10 references. (TES)",

        "description":"This digest considers the problems of foreign language instruction in small high schools and discusses possible solutions. A critical challenge for American education, pointed out by reform reports of the 1980's, is improvement of instruction in foreign languages to instill language proficiency. These national concerns have been translated into policy at the state level, but studies show that most foreign language students are enrolled in French and Spanish with far fewer studying German, Chinese, Japanese, or Russian, all thought to be good choices for students. Staff availability parallels enrollment patterns. Multi-level classes, the scheduling of two or more levels of a foreign language into a single class period, are common in small schools. This creates problems of  additional preparation and discipline for teachers and reduced oral language experiences for students. Suggestions are made for administrators to help teachers handle this difficult situation. Many state education agencies and universities are trying to help small schools offer foreign languages through interactive video courses delivered via satellite or microwave transmission. State education agencies are recommended as resources of technical assistance about foreign language programs in small schools. It is concluded that committed teachers are the vital key to both program development and program effectiveness. This digest contains 10 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"This digest reviews recent evidence of the positive effects of small-scale schooling on student achievement. Historically, larger school size has been viewed as an important educational reform producing cost-effectiveness and educational efficiency. Today, small-scale schooling is found primarily in rural areas and small towns. A 1964 study concluded that small high schools offer students greater opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities and exercise leadership roles. A literature study on the subject from 1924 to 1974 showed most investigators focusing on input variables and recommending increases in school size. However, studies that examined student achievement did not recommend increases in school size. More recently, researchers have turned their attention  to outcome variables, such as student achievement, and process variables, such as school climate and instructional leadership. When these studies control for socioeconomic status (SES), they tend to confirm a positive effect of small-scale schooling on student achievement. A 1988 study reports that large school and district size negatively affects student achievement in low SES areas, but positively affects it in high SES areas. Unanswered questions, however, include the use of state data, self-report studies, and other methodological considerations. It is concluded that further research can clarify the ways in which small-scale organization enhances the learning of some students, particularly those from low-SES communities.

        "description":"Data indicate that although science is required of all students in elementary school, elementary teachers do not usually teach science as a high priority or in a way that enhances student achievement. A myriad of possible causes for existing voids in this teaching process have been suggested by researchers. Teacher belief systems have been neglected as a possible contributor to behavior patterns which affect science teaching, therefore its investigation is vital to a more complete understanding of teacher behavior. This publication reports on a pilot and a major study in which the combined Personal Science Teaching Efficacy Belief scale and the Science Teaching Outcome Expectancy scale instrument (STEBI) was administered to measure self-efficacy or outcome expectancy. Results of  a plot graph illustrated two homogeneous scales for the try-out study. Results of the major study indicate that the STEBI is a valid and reliable tool for studying elementary teacher's beliefs toward science teaching and learning. References, means and standard deviations, corrected item-total scale correlations and factor loadings, factor plot of final factor analysis results, demographic characteristics, final scales, validity coefficients, and scoring instructions for the STEBI are included.

While some studies have found a positive relationship, others have reported nonsignificant results. The purpose of this study was to investigate high school students' (n=36) understanding of the concept of variable in computer programming and in algebraic context. High school juniors at a large private high school who had completed Algebra I and a computer literacy course were given the Algebra-Computer-English (ACE) Translation Test. The results of this study indicate that high school students with experience in both algebra and computer programming could work with variables in a computer context better than in an algebraic context. When  given parallel items in both a computer program and algebraic context, their correct responses were not uniformly distributed. They were better able to translate to English the variables in the computer program than in the algebraic equation. A list of 30 references is included. An appendix includes the ACE Translation Test.

It is based on the collective experiences of foresters and of local farmers and herders. Since many of the problems of reforestation of dry areas are the same worldwide, the text (which focuses on the broad subject of project implementation) includes methods and planning guides useful in more than a West Africa context. Following an introduction, text material is presented in sections discussing: (1) long-range planning (present land uses, community involvement, selecting sites); (2) soil and water (erodability, shallowness, texture, compaction); (3) selecting appropriate species; (4) project planning (natural regeneration, direct seeding,  cuttings, nursery planning, design considerations, seed preparation); (5) nursery management; (6) the planting site (preparation, lifting out, transporting, and planting, spacing, survival); and (7) uses and prevention of fires, windbreaks, and sand stabilization. Appendices include: a directory of 165 West Africa trees; an expanded look at 30 of these trees; maps and charts explaining climate, rainfall, soil, vegetation, and characteristics of sub-Saharan West Africa; guide to writing funding proposals for reforestation projects; and a list of information sources and bibliographic materials. The manual assumes basic familiarity with reforestation terms and methods. (CW)",

Graphs, charts, and illustrations portray trends, shares and locations of various energy sources and uses. The energy data have been selected from several Energy Information Administration publications. It is noted that although demand for all major categories of petroleum products increased in 1988 over the 1987 level, domestic crude oil production was down for the third consecutive year. Weak oil prices and low drilling activity were the two factors  most responsible for the decline in production. All other major forms of energy, except hydroelectricity, increased production while a favorable economy and adverse weather conditions boosted United States energy consumption to a new high.

A questionnaire was distributed to four schools in Texas, Minnesota, California, and Arkansas and data were analyzed using Boos's procedures modified for the use of Likert scale values. The three areas of investigation were: (1) the perceived qualities of the good citizen (10 qualities surveyed); (2) the perceived sources of citizenship influence (12 sources surveyed); and (3) the perceived contribution of courses and programs on citizenship (5 surveyed). &quot;Participation in community or school affairs&quot; was not considered by students to be an important contributor to good  citizenship, while &quot;concern for the welfare of others&quot; and the &quot;ability to make wise decisions&quot; were. &quot;Parents&quot; and &quot;friends&quot; ranked highest as having the greatest influence on citizenship formation, with &quot;coaches,&quot;&quot;religious leaders,&quot; and &quot;television and/or movies&quot; ranked the lowest. &quot;American History&quot; and &quot;Government&quot; were seen by the students as being the most beneficial courses for citizenship education, and &quot;elementary school social studies program&quot; as the least beneficial. Each surveyed value was presented by a bar chart with scaled values, differentiated by state, with inferences on the data and a discussion of those survey results given. Each of the three investigation areas concludes with a cumulative Boos summary analysis, cluster ranking, and data analysis.

The Municipal Council of Sydney took possession of the library in 1909. The library evolved from a closed access, fixed shelf position library to an open access system in 1910. A complete retrospective conversion to the Dewey system was achieved by 1933. Over the years the library initiated a newspaper reading room, a juvenile collection, a children's room, an inquiry desk, a bindery, and various other features, mirroring the development of public libraries, especially in the United States and Great Britain. Public support for public libraries was limited until the 1930s, with public libraries being viewed as a luxury. The Free  Library Movement of that time helped to solidify support for such institutions. The years following World War II brought more change with the opening of several branches in the suburbs around the city and a resultant rise in circulation. In December, 1976 cataloging and circulation were computerized, and microfiche catalogs were produced until June, 1986, when the library went to an online catalog and circulation system. Budgetary and circulation data are given throughout the document, and a bibliography of 29 items is provided. (PPB)",

The landmark case of &quot;New Jersey vs. TLO&quot; set standards concerning reasonable suspicion and reasonable searches. School officials must be familiar with recent court opinions on student searches, use good judgement as to the application of reasonable suspicion, and avoid careless or whimsical applications of student searches. If evidence is found, it is important that contraband materials be locked in a secure place where the chain of custody of the evidence is known and limited. Extreme caution must be exercised in the case of strip searches, since such searches are too instrusive for most courts to sanction and arouse aversion in most  communities, besides having been vociferously criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union and parents' organizations in specific instances. The apparent legality of the use of dogs to detect drugs varies within different federal circuit courts. School officials should check to see what guidelines their federal circuit courts recommend. While voluntary drug testing may be permitted, mandatory testing appears to be outside the scope of the law. The use of metal detectors as a search tool may be permissible if certain regulations are followed. Every school should have a conduct policy and a search and seizure policy spelled out exactly as to reasonable suspicion and reasonable search practices. Four resource organizations and nine references are given. Two newspaper articles are  reproduced, one on student searches, the other on the use of dogs for drug detection. A short paper by Justice Stanley Mosk on &quot;School Safety and the Law&quot; is also included. (PPB)",

        "description":"Schoolyard bullying, a pervasive and significant problem, tends to lead to anti-social behavior in the adult/parental years as well, perpetuating the pattern of violence in a new generation of students. Bullies, and often their victims, tend to operate at a unilateral, or one-way, attitudinal level instead of a reciprocal or collaborative level. Bullying seems to be developed in individuals through a process of socialization, often starting in the home. Similarly, those who are victimized may be the products of overprotective parents or the victims of abuse at home. In the worst instances, bullying may lead to murder or suicide. Basic to any program of intervention or anti-bullying is a clear repudiation of repeated physical and mental maltreatment and the discarding of the  notion that bullying is a manifestation of normal youthful aggressive behavior. The most effective strategy when confronting bullies is to make a stand and leave the field with dignity, but without violence. A list of 26 resources, a report to parents from the National Association of Elementary School Principals, and eight photocopies of newspaper articles are included. (PPB)",

The major source of data for this study is the &quot;1987 Statistical Yearbook&quot; of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Data are compared for three areas: participation (15 tables and charts); expenditures (11 tables and charts); and achievement (8 tables and charts). At the gross enrollment rate, the United States is among the highest in the world at the secondary level, and the highest  at the postsecondary level. The pupil-teacher ratio for the United States however, is high when compared to the other nations. The United States ranks relatively high in both share of gross national product (GNP) and of total government expenditures that are devoted to education, although other nations place a higher emphasis on spending at the primary and secondary educational levels. Achievement scores for the United States were relatively lower at higher age/grade levels in all subject areas, particularly in mathematics and foreign language (French). Tests were sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. A brief discussion and analysis section on the various tables and charts in each of the three data sections helps to provide meaningful  comparisons of the data. (PPB)",

The project consisted of a 6-part series featuring the speeches, workshops, and question periods from the forum. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the impact of the programs, to examine registrants' use of the resource materials that were made available, and to assess their opinions of the project. A random sample of 83 individuals who had registered for the available resource materials were interviewed on the telephone. These women were generally well-educated, 25-45 years of age, and held white-collar jobs outside the home. Over half of  the group described themselves as politically active, approximately 60% of the group claimed that the learning experience had encouraged them to become more active in politics, and 33% reported that they had taken some action to become more politically involved. The findings indicate that &quot;Women and Politics&quot; provides a suitable model for other part-time learning projects. Comments by the interview participants and seven tables of survey findings are included. (Author/PPB)",

Contributions range from extensive research to field work and observation. Enrique Mayer demonstrates that the coca leaf is a vital Andean cultural element whose use and economic role will not be easily replaced or substituted. Myrna Cintron traces the historical roots of the cocaine problem, arguing that the current crisis is part of a periodic cycle that has seen cocaine change from recreational use to an economic commodity. Ray Henkel describes and analyzes the development of the coca industry and the impact it has had on Bolivia. Harry Sanabria presents research on out-migration from a  high altitude peasant community in Bolivia and social differentiation based on coca agriculture. Luis Loyola explores the historical functions that alcohol consumption has had in peasant and Indian communities in Chiapas, Mexico, and provides an ethnographic account of the drinking pattern in Tenejapa, Chiapas. Raul Jeri's work on coca paste and Peruvian cocaine addiction shows that patients who present neuro-psychological disorders prior to cocaine exposure develop faster physical and psychological dependence. Rosa del Olmo examines the plight of women trapped in the highly rewarding underground economy. Edmundo Morales' paper on coca paste and crack explores the overall pervasive use of cocaine, its mechanisms, and the dynamics of manufacturing and marketing. Reference lists follow each  paper.

        "description":"Jewish schools, before statehood in 1948, were run by political parties. The &quot;General Stream&quot; (1913), formed by the General Zionist and Revisionist parties, agreed to have secular subjects taught in European-like schools, and to forego formal religious instruction. The &quot;Religious Stream&quot; (1920), formed by Zionist religious parties, focused on religious and Zionist emphases in its schools. The &quot;Labor Stream&quot; (1926) arose mainly among rural and urban workers, and was imbued with child-centered educational ideals. These three school systems were joined by a fourth group, the &quot;Ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Stream&quot; (1948), led by the most religiously demanding group of zealots. A religious and political compromise in 1953, which placed all schools under a Ministry of Education and  Culture, is the basis for the five kinds of schools currently operating. State Secular schools enroll 65% of Jewish youths and are considered to be religiously neutral. State Religious schools enroll 25% of Jewish youths, teach the &quot;Bible&quot; as the Word of God, and emphasize the religious nature of holy days. Ultra-Orthodox schools enroll 6.5% of Jewish youths, are extremely religious, require &quot;Bible&quot; study, and are governed by religion in all aspects of life. Kibutz, moshav, and other types of communal settlement schools, together with army-run schools, enroll 3.5% of Jewish youths, have varied religious emphases, and usually observe the Sabbath and other holy days. Arab schools enroll about 200,000 Israeli Arab youths. They are separated from Jewish schools, not by law, but by cultural,  linguistic, geographical, and religious differences. Some results of the 1953 compromise are discussed. (GEA)",

        "description":"Numerous reasons can be given for the low quality of teaching in the social studies. Teachers may be improperly certified, or they may teach to maintain employment rather than to do a good job. To teach peace studies courses requires the cream of the crop in terms of quality instruction. Teachers should be well above the minimum requirements for certification. Teacher education should include courses in educational psychology, philosophy of education, and teaching of social studies, and prospective teachers should have a good liberal arts background and complete a student teaching assignment. Secondary students should desire the best in teaching-learning situations. How to work toward peace should be an ultimate goal of peace studies. Disagreements between and among individuals  involve conflict. Conflict resolution will greatly minimize or even eliminate selected kinds of undesirable attitudes. Some attitudes detrimental to conflict resolution include: harsh rhetoric, traditional patriotism, ethnocentrism, emphasis on military spending as the best security, view positions from the point of view of one variable, and the friendly dictator concept. The Middle East is presented as an area in which wars have grown out of previous conflicts involving diverse nations. Teachers of peace studies need to be well-informed pertaining to the subjects and issues addressed. Proposed solutions must be just for both sides of the conflict, and a problem-solving attitude must be emphasized. Conflict resolution is a must in the academic/school curriculum. (GEA)",

Two surveys were administered to 45 first-year teachers, one in the fall semester and the other several weeks before the end of the school year. The surveys queried the teachers about their current working environment and their feelings associated with burnout. Factors measured were: (1) role overload; (2) instructional rewards; (3) job design; (4) role ambiguity; (5) classroom environment; (6) goal clarity; and (7) frequency of interaction with other teachers and administrators. Findings indicated that rewards obtained from student progress, and teacher and administrator recognition were the only factors determined to have a significant  influence as predictors of end-of-the-year burnout. It was also found that high levels of skill variety in the job did not contribute to less teacher burnout in this sample. It is concluded that providing positive recognition and adequate time for planning and instruction, as well as reducing class size, may reduce beginning teachers' burnout and attrition. (JD)",

This paper defines the concept of the culture of educational settings and asserts that school-university collaboration occurs in the intersection of two cultures. The sense a person makes out of life and work at a university differs in four dimensions from the sense a person makes out of life and work in a public school: (1) work tempo and the nature of professional time; (2) professional focus, from theoretical to practical; (3) career reward structures; and (4) sense of personal power and efficacy, or the connection one perceives between one's educational efforts and intended  outcomes. Descriptions and evaluations of various collaborative projects are reviewed, along with related literature. Evidence is cited to support the findings that educators who have participated in collaboration gain insights into the nature of their own and fellow educators' orientations with respect to the cited dimensions.

This approach, called \"Complex Instruction\", was designed to facilitate the development of cognitive, academic, and linguistic functioning of all students in heterogeneous classrooms. Organization of the classroom to provide equal access to the critical features of instruction (i.e., the curricular materials, interaction with the teacher, and interaction with peers) is among the crucial elements of this approach. Organizational sociology is used as a framework to develop an argument regarding the relationship between mastery of a knowledge base underlying a specific classroom technology, and  its actual implementation in the classroom. To support this argument, an analysis is presented of the underlying knowledge base and its relationship to the central features of classroom implementation of Complex Instruction, the instructional technology. In addition, descriptions are given of the conditions for developing teacher conceptual understanding, and the implications of explicitly incorporating theory and research into the teacher training implementation process.

        "description":"A successful program for staff development focused on moral development will view teachers as growing adults who will become more professional and successful as they are provided with a work environment that demands choice, automony, dialogue, and reflection. Such a working environment comes from the close collaboration of the administrator, the teaching staff, and the students. This paper describes a staff development effort which moved the faculty closer to the ideal of a new professional culture centered upon student learning. While this model examines policies within schoolhouse walls, it does have the power to effect policy changes outside of the individual school since it seeks to establish a richer understanding of the teaching profession. A case study is given of a  faculty workshop, organized around the theme of developing new norms to enhance the professionalization of the teaching staff by attending more responsibly to students' needs. Three dominant areas which needed to be addressed by the faculty were identified: (1) the students thought the teachers were unfair in grading; (2) instructional styles needed to be enhanced and expanded; and (3) the faculty endorsed both short and long term responsibilities for professional development. Within this presentation, supervision by the principal is seen as an obligation which seeks to promote the moral growth of the staff by attending to issues of injustice as perceived by the school community.

During the 2-year recruitment phase of their collegiate program, changing levels of expressed commitment to teaching as a career choice were evaluated at three points using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Data presented in this paper indicate that: (1) aspects of career commitment can be identified and described; (2) level and aspects of commitment are variable across time and may be influenced by institutional and personal factors; and (3) several of these factors may be influenced by faculty and curriculum of postsecondary education. It is argued that commitment to teaching as a profession  and a career choice can be developed and nurtured prior to the beginning of what is typically considered \"traditional\" teacher training activities. The notion of a \"sustained\" stage of recruitment of students into teaching is thus proposed. (Author/JD)",

The project focused on the improvement of selection and training of cooperating teachers and the development of a qualified corps of clinical faculty. Close collaboration between the college and the school necessary to the project was accomplished through a task force of collaborators from each institution. The task force addressed two salient problems: (1) the haphazard selection procedures for cooperating teachers; and (2) nonexistent or inadequate training for the role of cooperating teacher. Better selection procedures were developed and a university course designed specifically for helping cooperating teachers prepare for work  with student teachers was initiated. By reorganizing the student teaching component under one office, efforts focused on developing well-defined procedures to cover several important aspects of student teaching: (1) application for student teaching; (2) eligibility; and (3) agreement between coperating teacher and student teacher. The first section of this report describes the development and implementation of the project.

It offers a rationale for including physical education in the school curriculum. Guidelines for exercising children safely are offered, including a section on weight training for children. Chapter 2 includes the Physical Best fitness test, as well as guidelines for testing, measuring, and evaluating physical fitness. A discussion explains efficient test administration procedures and planning for fitness testing in the school setting. The third chapter focuses on special populations including obese and handicapped children. A number of suggestions for modifying activities to meet the needs of special populations include consideration of the problems of asthmatic  youngsters. Chapter 4 looks at fitness, nutrition, substance abuse, and the role they play in developing wellness in children. Emphasis is placed on developing positive attitudes. The fifth chapter offers many activities for developing fitness in children of all ages. Effectively teaching a class in the fitness environment is discussed as is the importance of understanding the role of fitness in the total physical education lesson. (JD)",

        "description":"Using an educational theory labeled the new sociology of knowledge, this paper examines how an individual teacher acquires, evaluates, and utilizes the knowledge necessary to live and work as a physical education teacher in a high school and in a community. The study endeavored to locate the sources of the teacher's occupational knowledge, understand the processes used in evaluating that knowledge, and recognize the modes and functions of that knowledge in physical education classes. Data collection and analyses focused on the culture and subcultures informing and influencing the teacher's work. Particular attention was given to the cultures of community, school, and profession. Findings analyze five primary sources of knowledge appropriated by the teacher: (1) the community; (2)  the school; (3) the teaching profession; (4) personal biography; and (5) occupational exerience. Results led to the conclusion that the teacher's personal biography and perceptions of the messages embedded in school and community cultures played primary roles in shaping and defining the teacher's pedagogical practice in physical education. It is noted that recognition of the cultural codes embedded in the intellectual activity of a teacher identifies the social mission performed by schools. (JD)",

The salient characteristics of each of the programs are described. Most of the subjects of the study were involved in coursework and practica during the year prior to the collection of data, although a few of the certificate-only students extended their teacher preparation over a slightly longer period. Data was collected when most of the subjects had completed their student teaching and were evaluated by their public school supervising teachers on their attainment of a specific list of 15 competencies. All the students and their  supervising teachers were asked to evaluate the teacher education program on the extent to which it successfully accomplished the goal of providing the knowledge and skills required to be a competent beginning teacher. The data is discussed in detail accompanied by tables. The results of the data analysis indicated that in general both programs provided the majority of the preservice teaching candidates with satisfactory knowledge of effective teaching practices and ability to implement those practices in the classroom. A comparison between the two programs indicated some differences in their impact. These differences are discussed and analyzed. (JD)",

The second strand involves a group of science graduates who undertook a 1-year preservice education course during which an intensive case study of the development of the members of the group was undertaken. A description is given of issues of significance for teacher education which were reflected in the program undertaken by the students. The  program reflected three broad areas of constructivist learning: student teachers' views of teaching and learning, their understanding of the content they teach, and their views of self. The most striking findings from the year related to the nature and extent of personal development, growth, and change experienced by many of the participants.

The theoretical framework for considering the teaching/learning triangle is based on determining the characteristics of the teacher, student, and patient/client and the dynamic realtionships between them that lead to effective teaching and learning while maintaining patient/client satisfaction with professional services rendered. A review of the literature reveals that most research studies on this topic have focused on one or more of the components of the triangle or on one or more of the relationships. The proposed research agenda focuses on determining the characteristics of effective clinical experiences for professional  students from the perspectives of the teacher, learner, and the patient/client, and the relationships between each of the three participants.

The discussion is framed around three questions: (1) What is empowerment in contemporary educational discourse? (2) What is desirable, and what should teachers be empowered for? and (3) What is possible and, realistically, what can be achieved? The paper begins with a brief etymological analysis of the term &quot;empowerment.&quot; In this section, it is concluded that the use of the term itself implies the acceptance of certain assumptions about power and power relations. Next, the term &quot;teacher empowerment,&quot; as it is used in teaching and teacher education, is examined. References are made to  conservative, liberal humanist, and critical educational discourses and specific notions of teacher empowerment are clarified. Reference is made to the structure/agency debate in contempoarary social theory in order to demonstrate some issues and problems of empowerment rhetoric. Recent work in poststructuralism and postmodernism, which offer an alternative notion of power, are considered. (JD)",

The study sought information on the general views of mentors and interns about the extended practicum and their roles in it. Participants  were also asked about their perceptions about problems they encountered and how they were resolved. Inquiry was made on the model of coaching typical for each pair and the extent research on effective teaching was put into practice in each classroom.

With the first, school-focused inservice education, continuing education activities are focused on the interests, needs, and problems directly related to one's role and responsibilities in a specific school setting. This focuses on teachers' concerns and needs as well as on matters which demand the coordinated efforts of other teachers in a school setting. The second type, which is individually based, addresses individual teachers' concerns and needs. It can consist of experiences to improve general competence or it can facilitate personal development and/or enrichment. The study poses these three questions: (1) What characteristics must inservice activities, focused on the implementation of educational  innovations, have in the opinion of experts in the field of inservice education? (2) To what extent do designers of the inservice education activities, conducted in 1984-87, take these characteristics into account? and (3) What are the relationships between these characteristics of inservice activities and their effects on the implementation of newly acquired knowledge, skills, and insights by teachers? The issues discussed and analyzed were based on the results of a modified Delphi technique, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, and six in-depth case studies of participating schools.

        "description":"One hundred first year scholars in highly selective programs in five American universities took part in a preliminary study of outstanding high school graduates and the teachers who had contributed in special ways to their academic success. Fifty-three teachers who were identified by the scholars participated in the study by providing information about themselves and by commenting on selected aspects of teaching and teacher preparation. These teachers were most frequently highly experienced in teaching; a large majority of them held masters degrees, and as a group they had been above average, academically, as undergraduate students. The students and the teachers they identified as having been important to academic success, generally agreed upon the characteristics of outstanding  teachers. Characteristics of an affective nature were most frequently mentioned by both students and teachers. One characteristic selected by the majority of both groups was the ability to motivate and challenge students. It is suggested that more studies should focus on the interactive relations of teacher and student. (JD)",

Observations about lab plans are presented on a program-wide basis. It is reported that the 3-5 year plans developed by the labs leave questions for the review panel about the overall clarity and vision of the labs' missions. This appears to led to uncertainty in the area of programmatic decision-making. The way in which labs set priorities was seen as not always clear. Some labs have experienced a profound shift of identity and purpose from being developer and provider of research and development to that of a linking agency, working  primarily with and through other educational service agencies. The following questions are discussed: (1) Are the labs to be pro-active or reactive within their regions? (2) To what extent should regional labs also have some national identity? and (3) Are the intended degree and benefits of collaboration among the labs being achieved?

The first topic also includes the extent to which existing knowledge has been disseminated. The second topic involves the identification of research topics that merit funding so that knowledge that can inform school improvement programs will be enhanced in the future. Despite the inadequacy of research to date, recent research has yielded important knowledge that is of value to educators. However, this research has only begun to address the basic questions that must be answered if student learning in school settings is to be understood. A summary is offered of classroom and school research that has the ability to inform practice; the need  to integrate these two areas is emphasized. In regard to topics that merit new funding, it is pointed out that it is most important to support research that promises sustained programmatic inquiry about salient classroom issues, integrating work on curriculum as well as on teacher and student variables. The present knowledge base and issues are discussed, and a research agenda is suggested. The role of regional laboratories, in view of extant and pending research, is briefly discussed. (JD)",

        "description":"Regional Educational Laboratories were created in the early 1960s as a federally funded link between research and development efforts in education and school districts. The labs were conceived to be sensitive to the practical needs of administrators and teachers for educational innovations that could be implemented locally. However, over a quarter of a century, the labs have been transformed by economic and political dynamics from a focused national network of federally supported, professionally guided knowledge diffusion institutions into nine, often entrepreneurially oriented &quot;job shops,&quot; sometimes only remotely related to local school districts, their agendas substantially influenced by federal officials and whatever clients they could gain from marketing activities, and  subsisting financially from competitively contested contract to contract. This paper describes the evolution of the Regional Educational Laboratories, paying critical attention to the governmental planning and political forces accompanying their formation. This analysis proceeds by describing the major changes in policy and operation that subsequently have shaped the laboratory system. Assumptions underlying formation of the laboratories are described, and conditions that have consistently curtailed their effectiveness are analyzed. The paper summarizes present laboratory problems and poses alternative strategies for overcoming them in the future. (JD)",

        "description":"As a background for recommendations made in this paper on the program of regional educational laboratories, three contextual facts are highlighted. The first is the increasingly prominent role and responsibility of the individual states in the definition and delivery of elementary/secondary education. The second is that, while historically public education has been governed, planned for, administered, and funded based on input criteria, there is a major change across the nation toward output criteria becoming increasingly important. Implicit in this concept is increased accountability which must be defined in outcome terms. The third fact is the changing workforce requirements of the economy. The declining number of young people encompasses an increasing proportion of minority  and poor youth, and schools fail to educate well a disproportionate number of those students. The nature of the economy requires a much broader array of new workers who have higher order skills. Recommendations are based on a need for universal high school graduation for all students, including those who are &quot;at risk.&quot; A concerted national effort is called for which will utilize the research and dissemination potential of the regional laboratories, the resources of the private sector corporate expertise, and the political sophistication of chief state education officers.

Concerns for greater effectiveness in support services stem from the growing need to effectively deal with some of the complex, lingering issues which to data have been only marginally addressed. Urban schools are increasingly becoming schools for the poor, and all institutions concerned with improvement of urban education must work toward increasing community support for these schools and help find ways to attract and retain the participation of middle and upper class families. While some progress has been made in improving basic skills in urban schools, curricular and instructional approaches are needed that will develop higher order  problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Research and development is also needed on early identification of students who are at risk of failure and dropping out. Good teachers are of crucial importance, and a closer collaboration is needed between preservice training institutions, regional labs, and urban school districts. To improve urban schools, the network of education research and development institutions must work closely together in developing new knowledge and in the strategic application of that knowledge for program improvement.

The laboratories are expected to achieve efficiencies by providing most of their help indirectly, by working &quot;with and through&quot; other agencies and organizations engaged in work related to educational improvement. Descriptions of the five ED programs include each program's funding level, purpose, activities, clientele, and requirements for coordination with other service providers and for evaluation. The review indicates that indirect service as practiced by the Regional Educational Laboratories appears to be a unique phenomenon in ED's technical assistance activities. The other assistance programs  typically touch base with some other assistance-oriented agency, most often a State Education Agency; they coordinate their work with that of others (chiefly to avoid duplication of services); and they may achieve efficiencies by training trainers or identifying and disseminating models. An analysis of these and other contrasts between the laboratories and ED's other assistance programs is presented. (JD)",

Drawing upon Office of Educational Research and Information (OERI) program documents and recent syntheses of research on knowledge transfer, this paper explores the following questions: (1) How does the laboratory program compare with similar or analogous initiatives in areas such as agriculture, industry, defense, and health? (2) What new strategies might be developed to enhance the performance of  regional educational laboratories in improving schools? and (3) How can regional educational laboratories improve their performance in transferring knowledge which helps revitalize American schools? The central argument of the paper is that regional educational laboratories are vital elements of a complex social system of educational knowledge. It is suggested that it might be prudent to focus resources on the design and conduct of quasi-experimental field studies involving alternative strategies for transferring educational research and development to those who need it.

The documents were largely management documents (plans, annual reports, self-assessment reports, etc.) rather than program documents. Following an introduction on the background and mission of the labs, chapter two covers the governance and organization of the labs and the approaches used to establish each lab and to negotiate its niche in the region's organizational infrastructure. Chapter three covers  the extensive planning system of needs sensing, capability, assessment, self-assessment, and priority setting. The fourth chapter deals with the work of the labs with state-level decision makers. Chapter five discusses providing research and development-based services with and through existing organizations. The final chapter offers a summary and conclusions.

The LPQ is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that yields scores on three basic motives for learning and three learning strategies, and on the approaches to learning that are formed by these motives and strategies. School learning is affected by personal factors--those belonging to the student, situational factors, and process factors; the students' motives for learning; and their accompanying strategies. The student's approach to learning is a composite of a motive and an appropriate strategy. Three approaches to learning are: (1) surface--the minimal meeting of requirements; (2) deep--intrinsic interest in what is being  learned; and (3) achieving--to enhance ago and self-esteem to obtain the highest grades. These three approaches are fairly consistent orientations and can be measured by the LPQ. There are separate norms for males and females at age 14 years and at year 11 of schooling. Directions for administering, scoring, and interpreting LPQ scores are given, with suggestions about how they may be used by teachers and counselors.

        "description":"A common thread in contemporary research in student learning refers to the ways in which students go about learning. A theory of learning is presented that accentuates the interaction between the person and the situation. Research evidence implies a form of meta-cognition called meta-learning, the awareness of students of their own learning processes and their increasing control over them. The concept of meta-learning leads to a model of student learning in which relationships among personal factors, the situational context, approaches to learning, and quality of outcome are mediated by the students' meta-learning capability. Instruments have been designed to measure the extent to which students endorse common approaches to learning tasks. These instruments--the Learning Process  Questionnaire for secondary grades, and the Study Process Questionnaire for tertiary (postsecondary) use--are published separately. The research that resulted in the formulation of the theory of student learning is described, as are the sampling, instruments, and methods of the basic studies that determined the reliability and validity of the two instruments. Important implications of the model for teachers, counselors, and researchers are discussed. Fifty-three tables and 17 figures supplement the text and present data and relationships. (SLD)",

        "description":"The theoretical differences between the traditional definition of dimensionality and the more recently defined notion of essential dimensionality are presented. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the utility of W. F. Stout's procedure to assess the essential unidimensionality of the latent space underlying a set of terms. The traditional definition of dimensionality makes no distinction between major and minor dimensions. It is desirable to count only dominant dimensions in psychometric assessment of dimensionality of a latent space. Stout (1987, 1988) has provided a definition known as essential dimensionality and has developed a statistical test to assess the essential unidimensionality of a set of items. Monte Carlo simulation studies with two examinee sizes,  n=750 and n=2,000, were generated with item parameters resembling those of real tests. Both simulations exhibited good performance in assessing essential unidimensionality. Since applications of item response theory techniques are becoming increasingly popular in most educational assessment, procedures to assess unidimensionality accurately will greatly facilitate the use of item response theory. Four tables provide data from the simulations. (SLD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to assess the validity of translations of two different forms of a licensing examination for cosmetologists in Florida to ensure that both Spanish and English candidates have equal chances of being licensed. The LISREL computer program was used to test the equivalence of factor structure, units of measurement, and standard errors of measurement between the original examination and the translations of the two forms. Data was from the administration of the Florida Cosmetology Licensure Examination in 1987, with 1,081 subjects taking English Form 1, 1,063 taking English Form 2, 151 taking Spanish Form 1, and 132 taking Spanish Form 2. All tests were written multiple-choice examinations containing 100 items. Initial results indicated that the goodness of fit of  the translation of Form 2 to the model was not adequate. A team of consultants and Spanish cosmetologists revised this translation for further testing on samples of 1,136 examinees taking the English and 180 examinees taking the Spanish versions. Results indicate that the use of factor analysis was a feasible way to assess the construct validity of the examination. Preliminary analysis indicated a weakness in translation of one form, but analysis of data from a subsequent revision of the translation produced a more acceptable fit. At subsequent analysis, parameter modification indices indicated areas of concern, and it was concluded that further research should be done to indicate how factor analysis can help rectify areas of concern. Six tables of correlation matrices are appended.  (SLD)",

        "description":"Combinations of five methods of equating test forms and two methods of selecting samples of students for equating were compared for accuracy. The two sampling methods were representative sampling from the population and matching samples on the anchor test score. The equating methods were: (1) the Tucker method; (2) the Levine method; (3) the chained equipercentile method; (4) the frequency estimation; and (5) an item response theory (IRT) method; specifically, the three-parameter logistic model. The tests were the verbal and mathematics sections of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The criteria for accuracy were measures of agreement with an equivalent-groups equating based on more than 115,000 students taking each form. Much of the inaccuracy in the equatings could be attributed to  overall bias. The results for all equating methods in the matched samples were similar to those of the Tucker and frequency estimation methods in the representative samples; these equatings made too small an adjustment for the difference in the difficulty of the test forms. In the representative samples, the chained equipercentile method showed a much smaller bias. The IRT and Levine methods tended to agree with each other and were inconsistent in the direction of their bias. Five tables and four figures present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The Title I/Chapter 1 Technical Assistance Centers (TACs) were originally created to provide assistance to state and local education agencies in implementing the Title I evaluation and reporting system. However, over a 10-year period, TAC role has changed significantly. Its service foci have evolved from providing evaluation assistance to helping clients in the use of evaluation data for the improvement of program operations and outcomes. The evolving service foci reflect the influence of the fervor of the school reform movement and the nudging of federal directives to expend increasingly greater amounts of TAC resources on program improvement. Based on experience in 13 western states and the Pacific territories, this paper traces the evolution of service delivery, identifies the  forces that have shaped the evolution, and discusses implications for future TAC work.

        "description":"The process of developing a state education indicators system using the model proposed by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) is described. The CCSSO model has three components--indicators of educational outcomes; indicators of school policies and practices; and indicators of contextual factors, or state characteristics. The goal is to relate educational outcomes to state program policies and practices, accounting for factors outside the education system that affect what schools can accomplish. Two projects are examined to demonstrate how comparative state indicators can be developed: (1) the design and implementation of the State Science/Math Indicators Project--an effort to develop indicators for monitoring and reporting on states' progress in improving science  and mathematics education; and (2) the National Assessment Planning Project--an effort by a consortium of 18 national organizations to prepare for expanding the National Assessment of Educational Progress to produce state-by-state comparisons of student achievement. Examination of these two projects demonstrates that the indicators are based on the analysis of what information is important to collect about educational progress in specific subject areas and how this information should be reported. Ten figures and four tables provide information about the implementation of these two projects. (SLD)",

Regression analyses indicated small-to-negligible effects of gender on mathematics achievement among these students as seniors. However, these findings do not mean that educators can ignore the gender gap in achievement that has been documented.

        "description":"A study is proposed that seeks to use the normally problematic factor of non-response to a survey in a positive way in order to estimate certain characteristics of a population subgroup. A longitudinal database, the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS) measures the educational, demographic, and employment characteristics of the nation's scientists and engineers. An examination of response trends for STPDS surveys reveals that response rates for foreign-born scientists and engineers deteriorate at a faster rate over time than do the response rates of those born in the United States. It is hypothesized that emigration accounts for these differences, and that the difference in the rates of decline of response rates can be used as a proxy for emigration of  scientists. Two very different approaches have been developed and will be used to test the hypothesis and to validate the proposed technique. Although this methodology is not generalizable to all surveys, it does illustrate the importance of a researcher's being thoroughly familiar with the survey population and the importance of being open to the possibility that challenging and testing the precepts of the practice of survey research can result in improvements in methodology. Three bar graphs give information about the proposed study. (SLD)",

Also examined was whether these variables retain independent predictive values when used in combination with other predictors such as high school rank, American College Testing scores, and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and Preparatory SAT scores. The Biggs Study Process Questionnaire, a short article, and a set of multiple-choice questions about the article were administered to 60 female and 41 male first-year students in their second semester at a small liberal  arts college. Achievement orientation and inferential knowledge predicted 28.7% of the GPA variance. Multiple regression analyses showed that learning process and reading variables (mainly achievement orientation and inferential knowledge) are significant independent predictors of first-year college GPA, even when used in combination with standardized tests, high school rank, or a combination of both. These results were discussed in terms of admission, retention, and curricular policies. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The possibility of developing a learning theory that is designed to insure its relevance to educational problems is discussed. It is suggested that the constitutive problem for an educational psychology of learning is how one learns things that are difficult to learn. Behaviorist learning theories fail almost entirely to explain why anything is harder to learn than anything else. Questions concerning the means by which learners learn to solve difficult problems restate at a higher level the same issue that all cognitive learning theorists must contend with--the means by which one can design a learning system that works without the need for an executive that is already knowledgeable. Problem solving seems to approach a satisfactory means of modeling this learning process. Findings  pertinent to this model, however, are quite preliminary and based mostly on case studies. Thinking-aloud protocols show that learners use four kinds of knowledge: (1) knowledge about knowledge; (2) domain-specific knowledge; (3) analogy to more familiar domains; and (4) expectations about the level of promise that a particular path of inquiry might provide. It is concluded that problem solving links cognitive psychology to learning theory. (TJH)",

The NELS:88 began with a baseline assessment of school experiences, with the purpose of relating these experiences to current academic achievement and to later achievement in school and in life. A total of 1,201 schools from 50 states participated in the base-year study. Out of 29,884 students selected, 92.9% responded. Out of 26,410 parents selected, 90.5% responded. The unique features of the NELS:88 and how researchers can use these new features to study educational policy and the effects of education on children are the subjects of this paper. One special  feature of the NELS:88 is that it focuses on eighth graders, thus creating a longitudinal data base that will enable researchers to assess the effects of elementary, middle, and junior high school experiences on high school performance and school completion. Both self-reports and teacher and administrator reports are assessed as well as the student's family and home environment. Special sampling procedures and follow-up methods are discussed. Policymakers will be particularly interested in data concerning primary-to-secondary transition patterns, school effectiveness, dropouts, parental involvement, equity of education across minority groups and for at-risk students, cognitive growth, ability grouping and tracking, needs of language minorities, mathematics and science programs, humanities  and history programs, and programs for gifted and talented students.

Validation issues in high-stakes testing are likely to remain a public spectacle, but codification within the courts will proceed in any event. (TJH)",

More specifically, the issues addressed are those associated with race, gender, and age. Questionnaires were sent to 2,801 mathematics and 2,468 science teachers or teacher supervisors identified by the Georgia Department of Education as certified in these fields. A total of 25 different forms of the Georgia Teacher Certification Test had been developed to represent the fields of secondary certification (grades 7 through 12) in the state. The forms were distinguished by task statements pertinent to particular subjects taught; the science form had 148 unique task statements, while  the mathematics form had 160 such statements. For science and mathematics teachers, respectively, 1,384 and 1,600 usable responses were available. Teachers rated the task statements by indicating for each one whether they actually performed the task, its importance to the learning process, and the possibility of successful performance by minimally competent teachers. Task statement content clusters were identified as well as simple effects and group mean differences. Results indicate significant effects based on race for science teachers, but no other significant effects based on race, sex, or age. Fourteen data tables and six graphs present study data. (TJH)",

        "description":"The Kansas Internship Assistance/Assessment Model, an effort to bring together assessment and assistance to maximize the professional growth of beginning teachers, is described. The program has two purposes as specified in the Kansas Internship Plan (1987): (1) to assist the first-year teacher (intern) in acquiring or improving teaching knowledge and skills that are essential to successful entry into the profession; and (2) to protect the public interest by establishing that the intern can perform at an acceptable level of professional practice. Unique points of the model are: direct links to assessment; administrators and assistance committees with identical responsibilities; assistance directly integrated with instructional leadership; a five-step performance observation  sequence; behaviors assessed in a quasi-developmental framework for beginning teachers; clinical supervision model integrated with assistance and assessment; the intern teacher is part of the assistance development; and evaluation is thoroughly grounded in research and statewide validity studies. Classroom observation, intern documentation, external observations, and student questionnaires were the four methods of data collection used. In the 3 years of model development from fall of 1985 to August of 1988, major validity studies determined the reactions of over 2,500 teachers and administrators. Data indicated that 89% of the intern teachers were positive or very positive about the program, while 93% of the administrators and 94% of the senior teachers considered that they shared a  common goal. Ninety-seven percent of the administrators and 94% of the senior teachers felt that their relationships with each other provided affirmation and respect. This professional judgment model gives beginning teachers a firm foundation for a career. A 45-item list of references is provided. Appendix A presents the Kansas Internship Assessment Inventory's master list of 38 behaviors, and Appendix B lists classroom activity codes. Ten figures and two data tables are included. (SLD)",

        "description":"The effects of monetary gratuities on response rates to mail surveys have been considered in a number of studies. This meta-analysis examined: (1) the nature of the population surveyed; (2) the effects of gratuities in relation to the number of follow-ups; (3) whether the gratuity was equally effective across different populations; (4) whether the gratuity was promised or enclosed; and (5) the year of publication of the study. The bulk of the studies was done in the context of market research. Findings indicate that a monetary gratuity can be a powerful tool for decreasing non-response bias in mail surveys. Although follow-up mailings generally increased response rates in themselves, the gratuity typically had more impact than did an additional mailing. The gratuity was almost  equally effective for professional and general populations. Enclosing the gratuity was more effective than was promising it upon return of the questionnaire. The year of publication had some effect in that the impact of the gratuity was slightly greater in earlier studies. The additional expense of the gratuity to improve response rates appeared cost-effective for most purposes. These findings have clear implications for survey practice. When differences in response with and without gratuities were found, they tended to show greater response integrity in the gratuity-receiving group. (SLD)",

Focus was on determining the relations between the ESB teacher scales and student academic achievement, progress through the grades, attendance, and dropout. This study was conducted as part of a collaborative effort of the CCSD and university researchers to increase understanding of grade retention and dropout in the district and to devise a plan to ameliorate these problems. The ESB assesses several dimensions of school climate by supplementing traditional academic achievement testing program data with indicators of other important organizational outcomes. Links were examined between the teacher scales and several measures of  school academic outcomes and student attendance in 42 elementary schools and between 11 and 18 middle schools and high schools. Student surveys of the ESB were not examined. The ESB teacher surveys measured nine dimensions of school psychosocial climate and seven characteristics of the teacher population. Results show that the ESB scales were related to academic performance, especially in the elementary grades; to attendance; and to dropout in the middle schools and high schools. These correlations often persisted when statistical controls for student ethnic composition and economic status were applied. Scales with relatively consistent and sizable correlations with salutary educational outcomes were safety, morale, planning and action, resources, parent-community involvement, personal  security, and classroom orderliness. Twenty-four tables provide study data (focusing on grades 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10), and two figures list the ESB teacher scales. (SLD)",

The NAIs are questionnaires that assess six indicators of school effectiveness: (1) instructional leadership of the principal; (2) emphasis on academics; (3) high expectations; (4) positive school climate; (5) frequent monitoring; and (6) positive home-school relations. The internal structure of the NAIs displayed limited convergent and discriminant validity, and the scales did not provide independent measures of the constructs implied by their names. However, the scores produced by the teacher instrument were often significantly and moderately positively  correlated with a variety of salutary educational outcomes, with most scales showing a similar pattern of correlations with various criteria. These correlations often persisted when statistical controls for student ethnic composition and economic status were applied. Result patterns suggest that the various scales of the instruments measured general or global positive sentiments toward the school rather than specific dimensions of school climate, and these generalized views were often related to positive educational outcomes. The student and parent instruments generally failed to show interpretable patterns of correlations with the criteria examined. Developing and using school assessment instruments in relation to the effective-schools-movement lists are discussed. Twenty-two tables  present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"A loglinear item response theory (IRT) model is proposed that relates polytomously scored item responses to a multidimensional latent space. Each item may have a different response function where each item response may be explained by one or more latent traits. Item response functions may follow a partial credit model (D. Andrich, 1978; and G. N. Masters, 1982), a multidimensional Rasch model (G. Rasch, 1961; and E. B. Andersen, 1973, 1983), or other forms of response functions to be defined by the user. Conditional maximum likelihood estimates are derived, and the models may be tested generally or against alternative loglinear models. The latter tests are sensitive to deviations from local independence subgroup invariance or assumptions about the form of the operating  characteristic curves. The model was illustrated through application to data from a test to identify learning problems in Dutch children from 4 to 6.5 years of age. Fifteen items were administered to 66 children aged 4 to 5 years, 132 children aged 5 to 5.5 years, and 65 children aged 5.5 to 6 years. Three appendices illustrate the dichotomous Rasch model, the partial credit model, and Rasch's multidimensional model. Two tables contain data from the illustrative study and three figures give examples to support the text. (SLD)",

Purposes of the study were to: (1) develop procedures for use in assessing item bias when the grouping variable with respect to which bias occurs is not observed; (2) develop bias detection procedures that relate to a conceptually different assessed trait--a categorical attribute; and (3) exemplify the use of these developed procedures with real world data. Models are formulated so that the attribute to be measured may be continuous, as in a Rasch model, or categorical, as in latent class models. The item bias to be studied may correspond to a manifest grouping variable, a latent grouping variable, or both. Likelihood-ratio tests for assessing the presence of various types of bias are described. These  methods are illustrated through analysis of a &quot;real world&quot; data set from a study of multiplication items administered to 286 Dutch undergraduates. Bias was related to a manifest grouping variable by giving 143 of the subjects some training in Roman numerals, in which some of the multiplication problems were written. Results indicate that it was possible to explain item bias through differences in item difficulties or error rates across levels of grouping variables.

Originally, a main question was to determine the likelihood of homogeneity of variance and covariance in these studies. A secondary question related to the extent to which empirical researchers using MANOVA techniques reported checks on the tenability of homogeneity before reporting their multivariate results. Of the 212 articles considered, 18 used MANOVA. Six articles that used one-way fixed effects designs included 25 MANOVAs and 5 multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA).  Two-way designs were used in 8 articles, with 12 MANOVAs and 9 MANCOVAs. Five articles used higher-order designs in four MANOVAs and three MANCOVAs. In general, for most realistic situations, similar parameters were found in the robustness literature. When the exact design configuration was not available, one could extrapolate between the parameters that were used. Only two articles addressed the issue of robustness. Results indicate that it is imperative that researchers test for assumptions before using multivariate analyses. Three tables give the design features of studies using MANOVA and MANCOVA. The AERJ years, volumes, and pages of the 18 articles assessed are appended. (SLD)",

The new method, called the Cluster-Based Method, assumes that the items in the bank have been grouped according to their item information curves so that items within a group, or cluster, are interchangeable. Introducing this assumption may reduce the number of decision variables in the model. Because of the assumption of interchangeability, the accuracy of the method will also be reduced, but this reduction is small. The process of test construction is independent of the particular item response model used. The basic model for cluster-based test construction using information functions is described. How the model can be generalized  to allow for subject matter constraints is shown. Methods of dealing with additional test specifications and selecting individual test items are described. The algorithm for solving the integer linear programming models is presented. Six test construction problems were then analyzed, and the results of these analyses were presented in three tables. In each case an item bank of 1,000 items was used. These examples revealed that the basic model for cluster-based test construction works well in terms of central processing unit time and accuracy. Additional examples of the test construction method describe the construction process for a selection and a diagnostics test and the process of constructing four parallel tests. Two additional tables give the characteristics of these tests.  (SLD)",

The MAIS is a computer-based adaptive instructional system. The problems of determining the optimal number of interrogatory examples in the MAIS can be formalized as a problem of Bayesian decision making. Two features of the MAIS decision procedure can be improved by using other results from this decision-theory approach. The first feature deals with the determination of the loss ratio &quot;R.&quot; A lottery method for assessing this ratio empirically is discussed. The second feature concerns the choice of the loss function involved. It is argued that in many situations, the assumed threshold loss function in the MAIS is an unrealistic representation  of the loss actually incurred. A linear utility function is proposed to meet the objections to threshold loss. Whether or not these two innovations are really improvements of the present decision component in the MAIS in terms of student performance on posttests, learning time, and amount of instruction must be decided on the basis of experiments. Research projects for these areas have already been planned. One table and one figure illustrate the decision theory approach. A 38-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"A non-linear version of redundancy analysis is introduced. The technique is called REDUNDALS. It is implemented within the computer program for canonical correlation analysis called CANALS. The REDUNDALS algorithm is of an alternating least square (ALS) type. The technique is defined as minimization of a squared distance between criterion variables and weighted predictor variables. With the help of optimal scaling, the variables are non-linearly transformed. An application of the REDUNDALS technique used data from a survey conducted with members of the Dutch parliament who gave their opinions on seven issues and their preference votes for political parties. This example illustrates that the non-linear redundancy analysis corresponds to a multivariate multiple regression with  optimal scaling. In the case of the Dutch parliamentary data, the REDUNDALS results are mostly comparable with the numerical CANALS analysis. The programs are combined, but CANALS finds directions in both sets of variables that correlate maximally, independent of how much variance is explained, while REDUNDALS explains as much variance as possible in every criterion direction. Two tables provide information about the parliamentary study, and a figure illustrates the monotone transformations of the variables. A 33-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

Fourteen sending schools were selected for study from a population of 105 low-achieving, low-income, predominantly minority neighborhood elementary schools that participate in an effective schools project designed to improve achievement levels. Eleven of the schools are predominantly black; three are predominantly Hispanic. Data on the number and gender of the students who participated in voluntary transfer programs instead of attending the 14 schools were obtained from the school system's computer database. These students' individual scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS)  were compared to the school medians of the sending schools. Each sending school principal was also interviewed concerning his/her perceptions of the program. Summary findings included the following: (1) about 4.9 percent of the total enrollment of the sending schools took advantage of the transfer policy; (2) the majority (56 percent) of the transfer students were female; (3) most of the transfer students scored significantly higher on the ITBS than those who remained in the sending schools; (4) the majority of principals felt that the transfer program created a two-tiered system that engendered unfavorable comparisons between neighborhood schools and special schools and had a negative effect on teacher morale.

This study compares two recent waves of immigration, from the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 1980's, and from Ethiopia in the 1980's. Both groups arrived during a period when Israel's social and educational policy of &quot;integration into the melting pot&quot; was in the process of changing to an approach that emphasized cultural pluralism. The characteristics of each group are compared and their economic, social, political, cultural, and educational adjustment are examined. The Russian immigrants shared common characteristics and responses with many of the earlier groups who had immigrated to Israel since its founding in 1948. However, the Ethiopians  presented a completely different set of needs, raising again the issue of the proper balance between the need to adjust to Israeli society and the need to preserve a lifestyle and religious practices that are radically different from those of earlier Oriental and Western immigrants.

Issues relating to amending the present law included the following: (1) the 30-day limit is unrealistic as proven by the large number of families who have needed aid well past this deadline; (2) the assistance funds could be used to construct permanent  housing for these families if federal law did not prohibit this use; (3) the development of temporary housing plans is a humane alternative to the present system of using shelters; (4) if more temporary housing were made available it could be turned into permanent housing later; and (5) solutions to the housing crisis should include the involvement of not-for-profit organizations rather than profit-making businesses.

Four types of factors were organized into a framework for conducting the study and analyzing the data: (1) student background factors such as ethnicity, gender, and length of time in Australia; (2) home environment and home influence factors such as parents' aspirations and expectations; (3) school environment factors such as students' attitudes and experiences; and (4) home-school interface factors such as quality and quantity of home-school contact. Parents' opinions were solicited through semi-structured discussions in the parents' native languages. Other information  was generated from open-ended interviews with teachers, community leaders, and social workers who had particular knowledge of the families. Qualitative results are presented for the following groups: (1) Vietnamese families; (2) Greek families; (3) Chinese families; (4) Turkish families; and (5) English-speaking families. In general, parents had high aspirations for their children's future but were concerned that schools were not organized to help their children go further.

National estimates of the number of homeless school-age children range as high as 440,000, at least one-half of whom do not attend school. The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 includes a section that addresses the educational needs of homeless children. Its provisions revise school residency and guardianship laws and require states to develop plans to assure that homeless children are provided the same services as other students. The following educational problems are most frequently cited: (1) transportation to and from school; (2) prompt transfer of student records from school to school; (3) incomplete or missing health records; (4)  difficulty in assessing the needs of transient homeless students; (5) unavailability of a proper home study environment; (6) low parent involvement; (7) lack of community services to support attendance; and (8) emotional and socialization problems. The following programs could be provided given adequate funding and support: (1) school-shelter liaisons; (2) after school and extended day programs; (3) special tutoring programs; (4) preschool problems; (5) in-school social workers and counselors; and (6) in-service teacher training.

Schools and colleges collaborate to solve mutual problems in the areas of student development, school improvement, and college improvement. Some of the most common collaborative activities include the following: (1) college-level study in high school; (2) academic counseling; (3) tutoring, mentoring, and skills building; (4) campus tours and contact with college students; (5) summer remedial or college programs; (6) parent involvement programs; (7) teacher development; and (8) curriculum improvement. Current collaboratives stress collegiality and equality in the relationships  between the participating schools and colleges. Issues to be considered in the collaboration process include the following: (1) leadership; (2) hands-on participation by partners; (3) funding; and (4) respect for the natural stages of development. Networks of collaboratives can share lessons, give mutual support, and develop models. Among other considerations, the general perception is that school personnel, rather than the disadvantaged students who were the intended beneficiaries, benefit most from collaboration.

A widely held assumption contends that the performance of the schools in preparing educated workers bears directly on the development of a productive and efficient economy. This study evaluates available relevant research. An introduction reviews the association between education and the world of work. The first section, \"The Needs of Employers for New Employees,\" describes growing concern about the adequacy of entry workers. The second section, \"Representative Studies of Employer Needs,\" summarizes 14 recent studies, including sampling strategies, substantive focus, and major findings. The third section,\"Dimensions of Studies,\" discusses six key variables that influence interpretation of the findings. The fourth section, \"Deficiencies of the Studies,\" finds significant weaknesses in the studies' interpretative value. The fifth section, \"Interpreting the Results of Studies of Employer Needs,\" describes the following perspectives involved in hiring decisions: (1) technical; (2) control; (3) institutional; and (4) political. A concluding section finds the linkage among employer needs, school reform, and economic development to be unclear, based on current evidence. A list of 27 references is appended. (AF)",

The program endeavors to benefit low income families by improving participants' food and nutrition practices, behaviors, and food consumption patterns. Only 5.5 percent of the 115 subjects (selected by proportional random sampling and typical of EFNEP participants nationwide) ate the recommended number of servings from the four basic food groups before receiving the instruction, but 22.1 percent of them did so after the instruction. Participants' scores improved an average of 12.2 percent in desirable food and nutrition practices and behaviors after instruction. The 12 lessons of  instruction were provided by nutritional assistants, who used one-to-one or small group techniques. The following recommendations were made: (1) repeat the study, using a control group and striving for increased consistency with which data are collected and (2) study the influence of educational level on homemakers' ability to improve as a result of participation in EFNEP.

Students involved in vocational education are more likely to be involved in school-sponsored activities that help them shape goals for themselves and the future. At-risk students (potential dropouts) should be especially targeted for vocational education programs that can prepare them for a decent future. A federally sponsored research report lists these six strategies for dealing with dropouts: intervene early, create a positive school climate, set high expectations, select and develop strong teachers, provide a broad range of instructional programs, and initiate collaborative efforts. A national  survey shows that vocational classrooms provide more educational experiences similar to dropout prevention programs than do academic classrooms. Vocational classrooms are more student-centered, more activity-based, and more individualized than other classrooms. (CML)",

Therefore, if economic growth is to be sustained, more older workers must remain in the work force or rejoin it. Some policies have been enacted to promote the employment of older workers. They include the prohibition of age discrimination and the gradual increase in the age at which retirement benefits begin under Social Security. Often, older workers must be retrained to keep up with the changes in technology that occur rapidly. Some barriers to retraining older workers exist, mostly attitudinal. Training programs are available for older workers; although they have been effective, they are few. Older workers continue to be underrepresented in job training and postsecondary  education enterprises. Economic growth in the United States will require more retraining of older workers and changes in the attitudes that currently limit such retraining.

Section II explains how the law's criteria for determining eligibility for JTPA unintentionally make many economically disadvantaged Hispanics ineligible for Title IIA programs. The remaining sections further explore why Hispanics eligible for Title IIA training are underrepresented and section III describes briefly which groups of Hispanics are underrepresented. Section IV discusses data problems, which account, however, for only a small part of the finding of Hispanics' underrepresentation. Section V examines three reasons for the  underrepresentation: the formula for allocating Title IIA funds to service delivery areas (SDAs), local policies and practices, and the method the Department of Labor permits SDAs to use for adjusting national performance standards to meet their individual circumstances. Conclusions are given in Section VI. Appendixes include charts illustrating the percent of population eligible for JTPA and percent of participants by selected characteristics and race/ethnicity; data on JTPA participation and eligibility; JTPA annual status report form; and JTPA performance standards worksheets for entered employment rate and cost per entered employment.

        "description":"A follow-up study was conducted of graduates from the Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture with a major in agricultural communications. The sample consisted of 68 graduates who completed an instrument that used Likert-type scaling. Procedures recommended by Miller and Smith were used to handle problems associated with nonresponse error; comparison of early and late respondents indicated that nonrespondents were similar to respondents. Results showed that the graduates tended to be white females whose highest academic degree was a bachelor's. More than half earned under $25,000 annually. Business and marketing, public relations, and writing and editing were major areas of employment. Graduates were very satisfied with their undergraduate courses  in agriculture, journalism, and communications and less satisfied with their basic education requirement courses. They perceived courses in journalism and communications to be more important than agricultural or basic education courses. In addition, they tended to be satisfied with selected undergraduate experiences and perceived them to be extremely important for future agricultural communicators. Recommendations included recruitment of male and minority students and use of findings by faculty and administrators to advise students and focus on the importance graduates placed on cocurricular activities.

For the Perkins Act, the report reviews the purpose, delivery system, and the implementation of vocational education (enrollments, quality of programs for target populations, services for handicapped students, program improvement, community-based organizations, consumer and homemaking education, exemplary initiatives, reports from vocational education advisory councils, and distribution and expenditures of funds). It also makes recommendations concerning vocational education for the handicapped, business internships for teachers, credits for private sector training, adult vocational  programs for older workers, innovative program designs, secondary-community college coordination, apprenticeships, vocational follow-up, career development guidelines, student organizations, and employment counseling and placement services. For the JTPA, the report reviews the purpose, delivery system, the working of the act (participants served, types of training provided, coordination between JTPA and vocational education, state education coordination grants, and other JTPA provisions), and makes recommendations concerning expanding coordination between vocational education and JTPA programs. The report also outlines the yearly activities of the reviewing council in the state. (KC)",

A survey of the program analyzed early operations in 8 of the first 10 counties to implement it; data were gathered from program staff, case records, and field research of the first 16-24 months of operation. The survey found that the eight study counties were generally successful in developing the network of education and training services called for by the GAIN legislation. A program model was developed to provide basic education and/or job search assistance. The eight counties' programs have evolved in delivering services, managing the flow of registrants through the services, and obtaining compliance with the  program's participation requirements. The systems are expanding to meet GAIN's demands. However, only about one-third of those eligible actually attended GAIN programs. The evaluation suggested immediate improvement in program marketing, participant tracking systems, money management, deferral policies, and basic education services.

        "description":"Adult learning theory and research on professional development provide a rich background context for examining school leader development for school improvement. The literature on adult learning theory identifies the following generalities about adults as learners: age reduces the speed of learning; adult learners bring life experiences to bear on new learning; adult learners exist in situations separate from the learning environment; and adult learners control what is learned. Research on staff development identifies characteristics that contribute to the success of staff development programs. Three researchers offer design components that emphasize a systematic approach to move participants from awareness of the new learning through transfer and application, a process for  promoting long-term behavior change through staff development. Other factors that affect the success of staff development programs are relevant to the content or design. Drawing from adult learning theory and the research on professional development, a single set of descriptors can be identified as components of effective programs for adult professional development. The descriptors are divided into three major areas: those that describe program content and how it is determined, those that describe the design of the program delivery model, and those that describe appropriate post-program follow-up with participants. An outline of criteria for program description analysis by Jocelyn Butler and Robert Blum is attached. (53 references.) (YLB)",

Sixty-eight percent reported that they are satisfied with their jobs, and 71 percent said they like working where they work. However, employees' responses vary as much as 35 percent in overall satisfaction levels, depending on where the employees work. In general, the older the worker, the higher the grade, or the longer the service, the higher the level of overall satisfaction reported. In addition to overall job satisfaction, the study's 64-item questionnaire  addressed the extent to which satisfaction was produced or hindered by specific policies and practices. It was recommended that, because not all employees are affected in the same way by federal personnel policies and practices, efforts to enhance the Federal Government as an employer should be focused according to these differences.

        "description":"The results of a study of the self-efficacy of 59 male and 71 female students, at a midsized western university, using a psychometric assessment instrument called the Career Attitude Survey (CAS) developed for the study, may be summarized as follows: (1) females but not males exhibited greater self-efficacy for traditional female occupations than nontraditional occupations; (2) females were more confident that they could combine home/family responsibilities with a traditional career than with a nontraditional career, whereas males showed no differences in confidence in their ability to combine family responsibilities with traditional or nontraditional occupations; (3) females considered traditional occupations more frequently than nontraditional occupations, whereas males  considered nontraditional occupations more frequently than traditional female occupations. (Self-efficacy was considered to be the belief in one's ability to perform a given behavior successfully.) The CAS included descriptions of 10 traditionally female occupations and 10 traditionally male occupations. Subjects used a five-point Likert scale to rate themselves along the three dimensions for each occupation. Internal consistency coefficients (alpha) for the CAS were .8914, .9123, and .6324.

A &quot;Coping Skills Project&quot; was designed to enhance this program by improving parenting attitudes and skills, increasing career awareness, and providing a proper single-parent role model to interact with these teenagers. During the project, assessment instruments were revised, and a videocassette recorder and cassette tapes were purchased. Teachers taped and edited public and educational television programs and used them to teach parenting skills and attitudes at much lower cost than purchasing commercial products. A teacher's aide who was a single parent was hired to interact  with the students individually, in small groups, and in the classroom. As a result of the project, scores on parenting attitudes tests, career awareness tests, and parenting skills tests improved, though some students were not in the project long enough to be measured on all outcomes. The project was judged a success and was scheduled to continue, with revisions, for the next year. (Report includes a list of videocassette titles and sample crossword puzzles.) (KC)",

The subjects were 60 men and women who had begun doctoral studies between ages 37 and 48, half of whom had just finished and half of whom had just started. Half of the students were from an array of traditionally structured schools, half from a single school (Fielding Institute in Santa Barbara, California) organized along principles of self-directed learning. All subjects completed the Sentence Completion Test of ego development (SCT), a projective measure that has been used for more than 30 years. Subjects also completed comprehensive questionnaires, and 17 were interviewed in depth. The study found that students  in the nontraditional school experienced significant ego growth, whereas those in traditional schools manifested ego regression. Pacing (the exposure to a level of cognitive or moral complexity that is just beyond the student's current developmental level) was found to be a significant factor in ego growth. Unconditional acceptance also was found to be an important element. The study concluded that a learning environment can be designed that will foster not only content mastery and skill acquisition but also human development. (32 references.) (KC)",

To address this need, a course called \"Professional Development\" at Southern Illinois University's College of Technical Careers takes students through the job search process. Course objectives include the following: (1) identify and apply career decision-making skills; (2) develop a list of employer contacts and sources of employer information; (3) prepare a resume and cover letter; (4) identify job acquisition and interview skills; (5) identify interpersonal skills used in interviewing; (6) identify professional development activities to maintain and improve  skills; and (7) identify and apply a professional code of ethics. A survey of 98 junior and senior technical students was conducted, using a Likert scale, to determine how useful students found the course. The topics of resumes, cover letters, and interviewing were highly rated as useful; however, the topics of compensation packages, psychological inventories, drug testing, job satisfaction, and self-appraisal of abilities were rated less useful than expected. The survey will be conducted again using graduates of the program who have obtained employment, rather than students as they complete the course. (KC)",

The three topics are (1) coping with AIDS, (2) health care for the elderly, and (3) the public debt. A report follows of the National Forums' first National Town Meeting, a national political discussion in the form of an old-fashioned town meeting at which key congressional members and national opinion leaders joined NIF participants. Discussion centered on the condition of the democracy and the roles of elected representatives and  citizens in the democratic process. The next report summarizes the choices made by Forum participants as they discussed the issues and listened to one another's views. Other contents of the publication include a report on participants' stories on how the Forums worked in their communities, a list of recipients of awards for distinction in special programming, a report comparing news media and NIF approaches, an announcement of 1989-90 issues, a report on a session on how to involve local policymakers in NIF activities, and a report on a panel discussion on possible collaboration between individual Forums and the National Archives and Records Administration.

        "description":"The adult capacity for critical thinking has many implications for adult education, and it is on this capacity that some writers have pinned their belief that adult education (as opposed to schooling) can be a liberating--even emancipating--experience. (Critical thinkers are able to learn through the reflection of self and one's relationship to the world.) A frequently voiced implication is that adults' education must help them determine what is good because adults can build the world they want through their control of adult experience. Critically examining experience can lead to the awareness that actions could have been, and can be, otherwise. If they are to incorporate critical thinking, adult education situations should begin with the learner's reality and cover situations,  not subjects, so that learners can reflect critically on their experiences and the experiences of others. Teachers of adults should attempt to close the professional distance between themselves and learners, so that they can become less concerned with transferring knowledge to learners and more concerned with creating knowledge and understanding by tacher and learner alike. Even technical skills and knowledge can be taught within a context that encourages critical thinking. Learners do not always want to think critically, so teachers must maintain a sense of their own limitations. Teachers who assume that their ideology--even if it promotes critical thinking--is the one and only true way of viewing the world are incompetent, not liberating, educators.

The researchers found little evidence of duplication of efforts between the two programs in the seven states they visited. The differences between vocational programs and JTPA--in the populations they serve, the kinds of services they offer, and their approach to vocational preparation, make duplication unlikely. The researchers also found that states comply with the coordination requirements in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act and JTPA. State and local officials said  that the 8-percent set-aside funds provided for the in JTPA legislation have stimulated greater coordination by funding joint activities and innovations that could not exist without these funds. At the local level, a variety of innovative approaches were found. Several of the models--particularly the practice of contracting for JTPA services with postsecondary institutions and the efforts to allocate certain functions systematically to specific institutions--suggest efforts to determine a rational division of labor among the various institutions. Suggestions for increasing cooperation include clarifying the intent of the 8-percent funds and increasing concern for outcomes of education in both JTPA and vocational education. (KC)",

        "description":"This final report describes the conduct of a project that produced a workshop on developing management case studies relevant to public administration in Pakistan from which six publishable cases with teaching notes resulted. The terminal objective for the workshop (that each workshop team would develop at least one extended case study plus a teaching note and include a signed release form) was developed on the basis of a needs assessment that included interviews with Academy for Educational Development (AED) officials, a review of previous consultants' reports, and interviews with the faculty and administration of the National Institute of Public Administration. The workshop involved a one-day presentation on case development; extensive individual team guidance and support in  selecting topical areas and agencies to use, developing interview guides, collecting case material, writing the case and the accompanying questions, returning to the agencies for their critique and signing of the release form, making revisions, and developing and revising teaching notes; and the presentation of the cases by the teams for the primary purpose of identifying areas for improvement in the cases and in the teaching notes. In addition to the 6 case studies, the workshop resulted in a commitment by 13 faculty members to forward the draft of 13 more cases and teaching notes to the project consultant. The document includes a day-by-day description of the workshop design, a discussion of evaluation results, 11 recommendations for consideration by AED, and a list of 25 references. A  variety of supporting documentation and the workshop evaluation forms are appended. (CML)",

Part I highlights the issue of labor shortages and sets forth some of the forces that are interacting to bring about the situation. Part II describes the kinds of adjustments that are required of workers and employers as labor shortages are encountered and outlines some potential dangers of precipitous policy reaction. Part III identifies the kinds of authorities and activities DOL  can bring to bear on this issue and provides examples of the options for action open to the department. Part IV sets forth basic principles that DOL believes must serve as guidelines for public discussion of labor shortages. (KC)",

Testimony stressed that Older American Volunteer Programs promote, protect, defend, and enhance the human dignity of the elderly by offering them the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to their communities. More  than 400,000 older persons took advantage of that opportunity in 1988. Statements at the hearing noted the many accomplishments of senior volunteers, from working with children, to helping combat drug abuse, to serving meals to senior citizens.

        "description":"In preparation for 1989 reauthorization hearings, the General Accounting Office (GAO) examined how well the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 is being implemented. The GAO reviewed the vocational education activities in six socioeconomically diverse states, visiting 20 vocational education institutions and observing 70 local projects in those states. The agency also conducted a telephone survey of vocational education directors in all states and the District of Columbia. It was found that vocational education programs and services consistent with the Perkins Act objectives were provided in the localities studied. However, vocational education students in economically depressed areas may be less likely to receive Perkins funding for improved or modernized program  activities than students outside such areas. All six states visited allocated more than half of their basic state grants to economically depressed areas, as the act requires. But some states designated relatively wealthy areas as &quot;economically depressed&quot; and gave them greater per capita funding than they gave some poorer communities. Further, since the disadvantaged population formula includes students who are academically disadvantaged but not poor, some relatively wealthy school districts can receive more money per low-income student than districts with high concentrations of low-income students. Finally, the study found that although the law requires a national vocational education data system, the Department of Education has not yet developed it. (Author/KC)",

Questionnaire responses from 32 teachers, counselors, and administrators in Michigan's second largest school district were analyzed. In addition to the demographic  information they provided, respondents used the questionnaires to rate the importance of, and their use of, 30 instructional skills they had learned to use during their ITIP training. The teachers reported an increase in their use of wait time, creating a level of concern, and creating an environment for success of the students. The majority of respondents reported that, after the teachers' training, their students more often had better answers to questions and responded to success, while the majority reported no change in 11 other measures of student achievement.

Reviewing factors affecting retention, the digest says that student characteristics, circumstances, and the educational environment affect adult students' persistence and participation in higher education and suggests that since educators have so little influence over the first two of those factors, they had better concentrate on the third. Among the writers cited are those who believe that educational institutions are &quot;out of sync&quot; with adult students, that many adults attend school for reasons other than obtaining academic  degrees (making &quot;degree obtained&quot; an irrelevant measure of persistence), and that institutions have taken three approaches toward adult programs (only one of which places the programs in the mainstream of the institution). The most relevant implications of several retention studies are presented in a review of retention models and adult students. A section on helping adults adapt to the university lists situational factors and psychological influences that affect persistence, as well as services and interventions that can help alleviate problems.

The first section reflects the disagreement between those who believe the purpose of literacy education should be to support economic development by preparing citizens for employment and for effective performance in a high-productivity economy and those who believe that the purpose of literacy education should relate more to liberating people for intelligent, meaningful, and humane action in the world. In the section on professionalization of the field, the digest discusses a number of factors (the use of volunteer tutors, the need for an integrated system to  support professional development, and a lack of consensus about what level of education and training is needed for effective performance) that have converged to direct interest to the professionalism issue during the 1980's. The section on evaluation of adult literacy programs calls for knowledgeable professionals to develop more effective evaluation of literacy programs, but recognizes the difficulty of defining goals for the evaluation of such programs when the purpose and goals for adult literacy in general have not been set.

It considered first the impacts of the changing global economy on Tennessee and the implications for education. The study found that Tennessee was likely to be harder hit than most states because of its dependence on manufacturing and the resurgence in rural poverty. Concern about adult literacy was generated by the demands of a changing economy and changing jobs. Study findings showed that education levels were very unequally distributed in Tennessee. Income levels were closely associated with the variation in education levels, with counties with higher per capita incomes consistently having higher proportions of high school graduates. The more  rural counties tended to have lower education levels. The distribution of kinds of jobs was perhaps the most important factor associated with education levels. The trade, service, and construction industries were positively correlated with the percentage of high school graduates. The presence of a high proportion of manufacturing industry in a county had negative implications for education. The presence of substantial numbers of white collar jobs in a county ensured higher education levels. Positive correlations were found between local spending on education and the percentage of high school graduates. Jobs and income were closely linked with education. (YLB)",

It discussed ways in which employment and training programs could better coordinate with development activities in enterprise zones. Some participants felt that leadership from the state and good working relations between the state and local programs were critical to the success of local zone programs. Many said that having one office as the central coordinator of all zone activities was an important factor in linking programs. Marketing was felt to be one of the most important functions for both enterprise zone and training programs and one of the key functions that  should be coordinated. Important incentives to coordination that were cited included state and local incentives designed to attract businesses to the enterprise zones and strong political leadership at the state and local levels. Disincentives to coordination in enterprise zones included the separate development of economic development and employment and training agencies and the threat that employers see in &quot;first source agreements.&quot; (The Working Group offered suggestions for the facilitation of coordination.)

In phase 1, a literature review provided the basis for a nine-cell matrix that conceptualized alternative models of industry-based training as a function of the skill level the training addressed and the degree of program development activity. Phase 2 was a series of investigations to ascertain the extent to which these conceptualized alternative models were used by business and industry. The research procedures were a telephone survey of Minnesota Technical Institute extension directors, focus group interviews with five selected extension administrators, a survey of businesses in Minnesota, and formation of an advisory committee. Findings indicated  that Minnesota's technical institutes conducted a high degree of industry-based training activity. Most of this training was targeted toward the manufacturing and health care industries. The study found evidence of the use of each conceptualized industry-based model. No \"one best model\" emerged; each model seemed to meet different needs. Barriers to the delivery of industry-based training as perceived by industry included availability of needed courses, program accessibility, and lack of confidence in instructor skills and abilities.

        "description":"A study gathered data about the career and professional development of experienced postsecondary vocational education instructors of the technical institutes (TIs) of Minnesota. Data were collected from 284 (of a sample of 394) subjects who had been employed for 8-12 years during the 1981 and 1982 school years and who would have had 13-17 years of experience as of the 1986 and 1987 school years, when the study was conducted, had they remained in service. Respondents were divided into those still employed and those not employed in the TIs. The group that stayed in vocational education was significantly younger when they entered the field than the group that left. The group that stayed rated both the work environment and the opportunity to work with students as significantly more  important factors, when asked to rate which of 11 factors had originally attracted them to the field. Vocational field membership was significantly related to attrition from vocational education: proportionately more people in business and office and trade and industrial education remained in vocational education, whereas proportionately more in agricultural and health occupations education left. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of gender, education upon entering vocational education, or roles occupied within vocational education. Experienced teachers took part in substantial amounts of professional development during the 5-year period of the study. (A 57-item bibliography and the questionnaire are included.) (YLB)",

The study used existing data from program evaluations of five postsecondary technical institute (TI) instructors. A survey instrument collected data from 120 (of a sample of 153) postsecondary TI instructors. Findings indicated that formalized staff development programs were not identified within the TIs. Respondents rated workshops, conferences, and seminars sponsored by business and industry as the most effective updating activity. Other activities in descending order of rated effectiveness were work-experience internships, activities sponsored by professional and trade organizations, and industry  observation and visits. Forty hours appeared to be the upper limit on time committed to an individual staff development activity. Instructors rated \"not enough time in schedule\" as the most substantial barrier to being technologically current. They indicated a \"high need\" for updating. Instructor-suggested criteria for assessing the technical currency of an instructor fell into typical categories: knowledge, work activity, updating activity, attitude/motivation, external evaluations, teaching activities, and performance test.

Section 2 describes the research base and the common assumptions that motivate and justify program development, citing pressures of contemporary society; specific research from the fields of adult and emergent literacy, cognitive science, early childhood education, and family systems theory; the importance of cultural differences; and the political appeal of programs. Section 3 gives overviews, activities, and some evaluation data for programs in four sectors: adult basic education,  libraries, family English literacy, and preschool and elementary programs. Section 4 presents a topology for classifying intergenerational and family literacy programs based on mode of intervention and target populations. The advantages and disadvantages of four program types are presented and critical questions for systematic investigation are posed. Section 5 consists of recommendations to support intergenerational and family programs. The document includes a 44-item bibliography.

Because the Head Start program creates an environment where staff work almost exclusively with parents or with children, it was possible to examine the perceived differences among workers attracted to child or parent work. Scores for classroom and non-classroom staff were compiled and examined by analysis of variance for significant differences. The results revealed that, while the mean abuse score for classroom staff was approximately 17 points higher than the mean score for non-classroom staff, both scores were within the normal, nonabusive range and the difference was not statistically significant. Stepwise regression was used to develop a prediction equation for potential abuse scores. Variables used in  the analysis were age, race, marital status, number of children in the home, education level, and staff position. Race was the only variable that entered into the equation. The implications for use of such information in the screening, hiring, and assignment of staff to various work roles and responsibilities are explored. References are included. (TE)",

It addresses special issues in the diagnostic and therapeutic interviewing of refugee patients who have experienced various types of physical violence and victimization. After a brief introduction, a background section reviews the variety of contexts in which refugees may have been subjected to physical violence, including the &quot;official&quot; violence of torture and prison camps, and the unofficial, random violence of war zones or resettlement camps. The importance of the source of the violence is emphasized; it is easier to dissociate oneself from the violence of a despised other group than from violence perpetrated by one's own nationality,  race, culture, or neighbors. It is noted that refugees may even have been forced to perpetrate violence on others, in order to survive, or they may feel responsible for the deaths or losses of others. Case histories are cited to illustrate these points, and the diagnostic purpose of interviews is highlighted in relation to such personal experiences. The remaining sections discuss the process of the interview and preparation for working with refugees, including the basic knowledge and skills required. (TE)",

The questions focus on: (1) physical assessment; (2) adjustment to host country; (3) problems encountered in host country; (4) problems in country of first refuge; (5) flight from home country; (6) decision to leave home country; (7) life in home country; (8) experiences of purposeful mistreatment or torture; (9) subjection to threats or coercion; (10) wartime or combat experiences as civilian; and (11) wartime or combat exposure in military. In the discussion that  accompanies each interview question, case histories are cited of common traumatic experiences that are unfamiliar to those who have never been refugees or war victims, and information is provided which may have clinical relevance either from a somatic perspective (e.g., central nervous system damage) or a psychosocial perspective (e.g., survival-oriented behavior inconsistent with previous personality).

This paper therefore draws on empirical findings and theoretical discussions from the psychological, psychiatric, nursing, social work, sociological, and anthropological literature in order to identify the major stressors encountered in the experience of refugees before, during, and after their flight from their native lands. Accordingly, after a background discussion of the global refugee phenomenon and a review of the literature, the refugee experience is divided into three task-defined periods. The first occurs prior to flight, when refugees bear both the stressors that lead to their decision to flee, and the difficulties associated with making the actual decision. The second,  the period of flight, occurs between the onset of flight and actual resettlement--often involving years of waiting and frustration. The greater part of the paper is devoted to the third period of resettlement, and portrays stressors associated with familial discord, occupational concerns, cultural barriers, and mental health difficulties. Specific stressors associated with refugee women and children are then discussed, and concluding remarks touch upon lessons to be learned and thoughts about the future.

An introductory section discusses the language, cultural, racial, experiential, and socioeconomic factors of refugee mental health and the problems of acculturation. After a description of the survey procedures, the two major categories of training programs are discussed: (1) agency-based programs and (2) university- or college-based programs. Agency-based programs are designed for employed or volunteer staff, and include both the &quot;home grown&quot; type, in which the provider agency designs and organizes its own training program, and the contracted type, in which  agencies contract for training from a variety of resources, e.g., individual experts, specialized training institutes; continuing education programs; national associations; and governmental organizations. Within the agency-based category are also formal, comprehensive programs which engage the entire provider system and staff and the refugee communities in a single coordinated training effort; one example of such a program is briefly described. Next described is the university and college-based program category which emphasizes academic and professional or vocational development, including pre-service professional training and continuing education. Attached are the summary reports on selected refugee mental health training programs, a selected list of national and regional organizations,  a brief concept paper on clinical training for refugee-specific primary care, and a selected bibliography on refugee mental health training.

After a brief discussion of the problem of job title, the functions of bilingual workers are enumerated and described: translation, interpretation, culture broker, outreach and community education, and mental health counselor or cotherapist. The next section addresses special issues and problems arising with bilingual workers, beginning with the psychosocial and interpersonal dynamics of the bilingual worker's  role as interpreter between patient and clinician. Other issues include training, certification and quality assurance, bilingual career development, burnout among bilingual workers, and the potential for the abuse of power by bilingual workers.

The functional and descriptive characteristics of each of these models are described and are illustrated by selected examples. General characteristics of effective programs are discussed, including the use of trained bilingual/bicultural staff, integration into the refugee community, awareness of the special cultural needs of refugees, integration into a larger system  of refugee care, and cross-cultural expertise among the service delivery staff. The bulk of the paper consists of an appendix describing 11 exemplary programs that illustrate each of the four categories: 2 psychiatric models, 2 community mental health models, 3 primary health clinic models, and 4 multi-service agency models. A second appendix lists all the refugee mental health programs visited by the TAC staff. A selected bibliography is also included. (TE)",

A number of symptoms, syndromes, and disorders that occur with greater frequency among refugees are discussed and summarized. These include depressive syndromes or affective disorders, paranoid syndromes, schizophrenic disorders or brief reactive psychoses, organic brain syndromes such as mental retardation and learning  disorders, somatic or psychophysiological disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse, antisocial personality or conduct disorder, and other conditions, including &quot;culture bound&quot; disorders.

However, a variety of therapeutic strategies can be effective with refugees if modified to account for cultural factors. Four clinical intervention strategies are discussed with respect to their applicability to refugees: (1) crisis intervention; (2) cognitive behavioral therapy; (3) dynamic individual &quot;relationship oriented&quot; therapy; and (4) family and marital therapy. These approaches were selected based on their demonstrated cross-cultural utility and on general characteristics of refugee psychopathology and interpersonal dynamics. Suggestions are made regarding appropriate modifications to account for cultural  factors within each approach. In addition, issues pertaining to the use of interpreters in psychotherapy are discussed, as well as general sources of difficulty in conducting psychotherapy with refugees.

It begins with an extended definition and discussion of the concepts of acculturation and adaptation. The characteristics of acculturating groups and dominant groups are briefly described, and a schema is developed to illustrate the concept of acculturative stress. Experiences related to psychological acculturation and adaptation are classified and described according to the phase of the acculturation process: pre-departure, flight, first asylum, claimant status, settlement, and adaptation. The paper concludes with five general observations on acculturation stress with regard to  refugees: (1) they are powerless with respect to dominant groups both before and after departure; (2) countries of first asylum are often least able to assimilate new arrivals; (3) lack of voluntariness or mobility creates stress; (4) the probable sequence of acculturation for refugees is highly likely to lead to psychological and social problems; and (5) the major stressors are in the early phases of the refugee experience.

Barriers that refugees experience in receiving services are next discussed, along with the basic issues that clinical programs must address to meet refugee needs. The staffing needed for an effective program is considered, including the psychiatrist, the bilingual mental health workers, and other therapists, while program content should include cross-culturally valid psychiatric assessment, regular program evaluation, and medical evaluation of refugees. After a  hypothetical discussion of the ideal program and the barriers to achievement of such an ideal, the psychiatric program for Southeast Asian refugees at the Oregon Health Sciences University is described to illustrate various approaches to providing refugee mental health services.

The paper begins with a discussion of the following issues: (1) centralized versus decentralized state mental health systems; (2) specialized versus mainstream programs; and (3) locus of control in state and county mental health systems. This is followed by a discussion of the characteristics and distribution of the refugee population from state to state, the varying state approaches to resource allocation, and the emergence of coalitions of various ethnic groups. The remaining sections discuss the scale of the overall service system and its  resources within states, new potential funding resources, and regional coordination of resources.

        "description":"Refugee movements impose tremendous psychological and physical trauma on survivors, making refugees a high risk group for psychopathology and psychosocial adjustment problems. This paper explores the traditional impediments to developing prevention programs for refugees and describes public mental health strategies that could be used for different refugee mental health problems. It describes and evaluates the following models for prevention programs with refugees: the classic disease prevention model; the stressful life event model; and the prevention equation model. It also reviews the substantial body of knowledge on the refugee experience and its mental health implications. It notes that experience with recent refugee groups indicates that a coordinated nationwide initiative  is required for refugee mental health. Accordingly, the paper provides a series of recommendations for prevention of psychosocial adjustment problems first in refugee camps and then during final resettlement. It then provides examples of possible intervention strategies for the most common forms of psychopathology in refugees: depression; anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders; somatization; paranoid syndromes; addictive disorders; conduct disorders; schizophrenia; psychosis; and organic brain syndromes such as learning disorders and retardation.

        "description":"This document outlines the basic federal, state, and local financing structure for child support programs. The main components of program financing are discussed, including: (1) the federal government currently pays 68 percent of state and local costs of program administration and rewards states and localities based on their collections and cost effectiveness; (2) child support enforcement can increase state revenues by offsetting welfare costs since child support can remove children from poverty and reduce Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) growth rates and parent's health insurance can save Medicaid funds; and (3) federal incentive money and the state share of collections on behalf of AFDC recipients can be used as the state chooses. Highlighted are creative state  initiatives that incorporate performance-based models into the administration and financing of state programs for child support enforcement. Known enforcement tools and management techniques which can increase effectiveness and efficiency are discussed, including placing greater emphasis on the establishment of paternity, assuring adequate levels of child support through review and modification of child support orders, and providing automatic income withholding from an absent parent's paycheck. Case studies provide examples of successful state initiatives. The report concludes that child support is no longer solely considered to be a &quot;welfare&quot; program; it is a socially beneficial program that can be implemented at minimal state cost. (ABL)",

Elementary schools were ranked according to estimated socioeconomic status of the students and 20 representative schools were chosen for the study. Since the high costs of measuring the children's unmet mental health needs were prohibitive, the study focused on educator's perceptions to answer its major questions. Over 400 educators serving as participants included principals, teachers, and the members of each school's Special Education and Related Services team. A questionnaire was used which focused on self-image,  relationships with peers and adults, school skills and competencies, and other behavioral/emotional concerns. Participants were also interviewed. Results showed that educators perceived numerous unmet mental health needs involving 15-30 percent of the elementary school students and most felt these needs were increasing. Self-image ranked as the greatest need, followed by interpersonal relationships, and school skills and competencies. It is recommended that the educational community take immediate, bold steps to address the mental health needs of children. (ABL)",

        "description":"Little research has investigated the relationships among sources, outcomes, and moderators of stress. There is a particular lack of such work with children and adolescents, especially work describing how the process unfolds with respect to the influence of continuing everyday stressors, such as those associated with the demands of schooling. This study examined the effects of school-related role strain on two student outcomes: grade point average and self-esteem. Subjects (N=120) were part of a 3-wave longitudinal study of the transition from elementary school to middle school in a small city district. Self-esteem was significantly predicted by both perceived strain magnitude and competence in a hierarchical regression equation. Competence served as a moderator of the effects of  strain on self-esteem. Both strain magnitude and academic competence predicted grade point average when included in a regression equation along with father's education. Results point to the importance of early adolescent's perceptions of competence in academic and social domains and a positive sense of physical attractiveness to general self-esteem. Just as important to self-esteem as competence, however, is an environment that is relatively free of strain, that is to say, one in which parents, teachers, and peers hold role expectations that meet the developmental needs of early adolescents.

Subjects included 120 fifth-grade students who attended one of two elementary schools which fed into the same middle school in a small city school district. The Early Adolescent School Role Strain Inventory was administered as a part of the larger Middle School Transition Study Questionnaire. Results indicated that: (1) students did not experience more strain in the team-taught middle school program as compared to elementary school; (2) boys endorsed more strains in elementary  school than did girls but were not more bothered by the strains; and (3) boys exhibited relatively greater declines in the number and magnitude of strains during the transition to middle school than did girls. Although results are not generalizable to different school and community contexts, the role strain approach promises to be a useful tool for identifying strains that may affect early adolescents' adjustment to school and school transitions.

In this study, self-reported food addicts completed a questionnaire that assessed demographic as well as behavioral and cognitive factors related to their eating. The intent was to describe the characteristics of a large community sample of persons with compulsive eating disorders, as well as to describe demographic and behavioral differences between bulimics and compulsive overeaters or food addicts who generally are obese. Data were collected through the Food Addiction Hot Line, a national referral and information source advertised to compulsive eaters which referred callers to Overeater's Anonymous and sent them a packet  of information about food addiction and compulsive eating and a data-collection survey. Approximately 11,000 calls have been logged, with more than 2,500 surveys returned. Except for differences in the incidence of purging or other abnormal weight-control methods, the sample was homogeneous. Most respondents were obese, worried about their weight and shape, had out-of-control eating, ate refined carbohydrates in binges, and usually had binges more than once a day. Although most individuals would not be diagnosed as bulimic, they suffered from similar compulsive eating disorders. The data reflect a real public health issue that needs to be addressed. (ABL)",

Following puberty there is a sharp increase in the frequency of depression among girls and an apparent decrease in the frequency of depression in boys. The Block and Block longitudinally-followed sample was used in this study in which subjects (N=87) at age 18, completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Scores on this scale were then related to psychologically comprehensive observer evaluations and self-report ratings of adolescent personality. Results showed that 18-year-old adolescents with depressive tendencies differed, as early as grade school, in their personality structure. Male dysthymic adolescents were  externalizing; female dysthymic adolescents were internalizing. These gender differences continued over the next decade and into adolescence. As might be expected from relations spanning many years, and with many other influences operating in between, these prospective relations were not as strong as concurrent results. These gender-differentiated findings raise the possibility that there is a personality structure vulnerable to depression, that this vulnerability can be identified early in life, and that it differs for girls and boys.

        "description":"Creativity research has traditionally regarded the creative process as involving a full or partial regression of the ego to a more primitive state of consciousness. An alternative interpretation involves an ego-syntonic concept. This developmental model of ego-syntonic play and its role in creativity is derived from a synergistic combination of concepts from psychoanalytic and Vygotskian paradigms. While some play and creative activities may be characterized by voluntary and/or involuntary regressions, an ego-syntonic state provides access to the unconscious imagination without a corresponding loss of ego functions. Moreover, when play and creativity become ego-syntonic activities, unconscious processes such as imagination become consciously directed and work in collaboration  with normal ego functions such as logical thought. Three types of parent-child interactions can be identified that have implications for the types of play and creative processes found in adults. These are: (1) the parent who is critical of play, who does not encourage the child's exploration, expression, or fantasizing; (2) the parent who allows the child to play but does not offer direction; and (3) the parent who encourages the child to play, is tolerant of the child's mistakes and silliness, and even plays along with the child. The experiences of the ego-syntonic state may be maximized by the individual's learning how to use inner speech to evoke and monitor the cognitive processes and emotions involved in the ego-syntonic condition.

Five quantitative and three qualitative measures were collected and analyzed in regard to academic performance, retention, and student satisfaction data on the 226 students enrolled in the courses during the fall of 1986. Experimental statistics included the correlation of retention, reading score, future grade point average, as well as a comparison to a similar control group who were not placed in the developmental courses. Descriptive statistics included data gathered by a mailed  questionnaire and 60 personal interviews on degree of satisfaction, skills usage, and perception of proficiency gained from instruction in these classes. Analysis suggests that developmental courses are effective in addressing the basic mathematics, reading/study skills, and composition skill deficiencies of many entering college students. Three-fourths of the students interviewed felt they were reading and writing as well as other college students.

Teachers learn instructional strategies and techniques within the framework of the total reading process incorporating reading, writing, and oral communication skills. In turn, the teachers show their students how to apply these strategies and techniques in order to monitor their reading and learning. The project consists of three components: (1) a pre-institute session held one afternoon in May which focuses on course requirements and an overview of the structure of the summer institute; (2) an 8-day summer institute; and (3) a one-hour follow-up course in the  fall.

        "description":"To help remedy the problem of college freshmen being unable to explore the diversity of writing strategies expected of them, an extensive review of current research on the composing process was undertaken. Freshmen writers must realize that composing is often a messy, recursive process based on rhetorical awareness, out of which clear and correct prose evolves through revision. Through the messiness of recursion, revision and rhetoric, good writers constantly reexamine their developing drafts to redefine, elaborate, and test ideas and to anticipate the reader's response. English teachers can easily emphasize these composing strategies in one-on-one conferences so that their freshman students will review, rethink, and revise their ideas from the jumble they have created on paper.  Then these students can leave the classroom or writing lab possessing the strategies and skills needed to face the diversity of academic discourse in college. (Thirty-seven references are attached.)

Subjects, six freshmen enrolled in writing with computer classes and five more experienced writers for whom writing constitutes a major part of their work activities, were interviewed about their writing with word processing, were observed while writing in their natural environments, and kept process logs of the writing they were doing. Results indicated that: (1) individuals have difficulties reading their own writing on-line and they often supplement word processing with  hard copy printouts for reading; (2) writers check formatting, proofreading, organization, and get a sense of the text from a hard copy; and (3) while there are differences in how student writers and more experienced writers use hard copy for reading, task variables such as length and difficulty may be important too.

The study had two major objectives: (1) to study the nature of the Forum page (a readers' letter page in which the government also participates); and (2) to observe if changes corresponding to the changes in press freedom were apparent on the Forum page. Altogether, the sample located 716 letters on the Forum page, and these were classified under 21 topics. Findings indicated that the change in press climate over the two periods did not bring about any major change on the Forum page; the guided press policy of Singapore manifested itself  mainly, and possibly only, in the topics addressed, at least as far as the Forum page was concerned.

Thirty of the students were involved in the process-oriented approach where students are encouraged to write multiple drafts of assignments, attending to issues of content in initial drafts and dealing with correction of mechanical errors in the final stages of editing. Twenty of the students participated in the product-oriented approach which may be characterized by single draft assignments which are graded by the teacher with high importance placed on mechanics. Motivation constructs considered in the study included: (1) entity (ability is stable) versus incremental (ability increases with  effort) theories of writing ability; (2) initial importance of mechanics versus content; (3) confidence; (4)intrinsic motivation; (5) utility value; and (6) perceived competence. Results indicated that motivational factors may be instrumental in mediating students' actual performance of writing tasks in the classroom, and motivational consequences may differ as a result of process and product oriented approaches to writing instruction.

Each respondent was sent a cover letter and a 34-item questionnaire. Results indicated that schools have a variety of means for controlling newspaper content, but that there was no significant difference between advisers at small and large schools on the questions concerning how advisers oversee their newspapers' content. School size did appear to be related to the type of controversial articles that appeared in  school papers, however. In addition, findings indicated that the Hazelwood decision would not affect the content of school publications. A table provides responses of advisors to 16 of the survey questions. (MM)",

A saturation sample of 58 newspapers that competed in various cities with no joint operating agreement or joint ownership was drawn. A list of 20 probable factors of success (including success through people, acquiescence to the community, focus on company image, and manipulation of the familiar) was drawn based on items frequently mentioned in texts and by newspaper officials. A survey of primarily Likert-scale questions was mailed in January 1987 to five officials of each paper (publisher, editor, circulation manager, advertising manager, and marketing  director). Respondents rated the items according to their importance for newspaper success. Findings indicated that respondents rated good reporting and writing as the most important factor for a successful newspaper, while the ethnic makeup of their staffs and the balance of sexes was regarded as not important to success. Findings also revealed a significant difference between leading and trailing papers in some items and a preference for qualified people instead of product manipulation as a path for business success.

The final editions of &quot;The Times&quot; of Shreveport and the &quot;Shreveport Journal&quot; which appeared over the four-day period of a riot were analyzed and the content of each story was categorized. Results indicated: (1) both newspapers used more &quot;unknown&quot; than &quot;known&quot; sources; (2) the larger circulation paper--&quot;The Times&quot;--used a greater diversity of sources than the smaller circulation paper; (3) the newspaper coverage emphasized manifestations of discontent rather than analyzing the causes of the protest; (4) coverage tended to have more of an order-authority orientation rather than an issue-orientation; (5) the larger circulation paper devoted more  coverage to order issues than the smaller circulation paper; and (6) there was no significant difference in the intensity of coverage. Findings appear to indicate that news values of conflict and of order, as well as competitive and market factors, exert some degree of influence. Findings also suggest that such influences win out regardless of the predominant usage of one type of news source. (Twenty-one notes are included, and two tables of data are attached.) (RS)",

Findings indicated that women's advice columns mirrored the function of the mother for the culture by instructing her cultural daughter in her duties, often encouraging subversive reading of dominant discourse as a means for the daughter to negotiate a viable position in the patriarchal structure.

In an age when over-the-road travel was difficult and air travel was just emerging, reasons for air delivery included: (1) the condition of roads (the majority of the roads in the &quot;Gazette's&quot; circulation area were either dirt or gravel, with widely varying standards of maintenance); (2) increasing postal rates; (3) the general interest in aviation, which had increased greatly in the previous decade; and (4) the enterprising nature of the &quot;Gazette's&quot; publisher, Harry D. Strunk. Although a windstorm put &quot;The Newsboy&quot; out of  service in 1930, Strunk succeeded in establishing a broader base of loyal readers through this effort.

A major purpose in conducting the survey was to develop a questionnaire that could be used to collect information for a longitudinal study, beginning with high school journalism students and following them through college and into careers in journalism. Results indicated that survey responses of professional journalists are more similar to  those of journalism students than to those of communications students in general.

Studies were gathered primarily from &quot;Communication Abstracts,&quot; the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), &quot;Journalism Monographs,&quot; several dissertation and thesis indices, and previous studies. Data gathered included year of publication, size and nature of the sample, qualitative descriptions of the portrayal, and any other pertinent factors that offered a glimpse of how women are portrayed in newspapers' news pages. Analysis indicated that in general, the studies showed a consistent pattern of unequal  treatment of women in the news pages. The treatment of women improved only slightly (or not at all) from the time of the 1973 study until recently, despite the entrance of more women into the work force and increasing media coverage given to women's rights.

Traditional metaphors that have organized research on news are reviewed and criticized for allowing news to be experienced in a limited way that encourages talk of bias, truth, fact, source, and objectivity and discourages other kinds of talk, such as theme, scene, language, meaning, genre, and convention. A research review of scholarly work in various disciplines is presented and criticized as being somewhat fragmented and marginal in attempting to illuminate discussions of news with  such metaphors as news as social science, news as ritual, news as organizational product, and news as myth. However, the paper suggests that many of the insights culled from these alternative metaphors for news might be reorganized, brought together and extended through the metaphor of news as drama.

        "description":"Gerontologists have studied the role of memory and reminiscence in later life to see if life review leads to increased satisfaction in old age. Novelists offer some concrete examples of the varying ways that this review can affect the self-esteem of aging persons. Molly Keane, Elizabeth Bowen, and Peter Taylor all agree that late middle age provides a potential turning point in the lives of their characters. In fact, the action of their novels depends on the way in which the characters meet or fail to meet that challenge. These novelists write about intense, sensitive and inhibited people, who live in an upper-middle class milieu. Because their backgrounds have been socially constrained, at first growth in old age seems unlikely. Still all of the characters feel compelled to  review their pasts in order to understand themselves better. The authors present this review in different ways, but two offer a modicum of hope. Of course, some characters cannot reassess their lives because they are committed to their old rationalizations. But those who can withstand the pain of self-revelation can sometimes transform their relationship with the past, an act which gives them some real hope for future happiness. (Author)",

        "description":"Public information campaigns have become a staple of contemporary crime prevention efforts. While formal research on such campaigns has been limited, some important lessons may be learned from evaluation of the national &quot;Take a Bite Out of Crime&quot; or &quot;McGruff&quot; crime prevention campaign initiated in 1979. A large-scale formal survey evaluation indicated that McGruff seems to have had some success in promoting various aspects of crime prevention competence among a fairly wide range of citizens. A national survey of 759 crime prevention practitioners revealed that the McGruff campaign has served as a centerpiece for a host of allied preventive efforts at local, statewide, and national levels. A survey of 53 television station public service managers indicated considerable receptivity  to the McGruff public service announcements. McGruff's effectiveness may be tied in part to the use of formative research in its design, and to the integration of interpersonal and community-level support with the media components. Subsequent campaigns would do well to pay more attention to the use of theoretical models of communication and persuasion in their design, and should include a more detailed examination of characteristics of audiences. Continuing, systematic evaluation should address the role of news media in campaign dissemination, and examine why some techniques work while others don't. (Forty-four references are attached.)

As debate has refined the issue, it is generally accepted that many aspects of scientific work are value-laden, that scientists after all are human, and their values, preferences and biases influence their work in numerous ways, thus rendering the thesis of fact/value separation untenable. The untenability of fact/value separation has implications for journalists and journalism educators: journalists should be wary, and students should be taught to be wary, of calls for fact/value separation that &quot;sub rosa&quot; limit the range of issues  considered.

The data were evaluated in order to test two hypotheses: (1) programming schedules prepared under conditions of greater freedom of speech and freedom of expression, when compared to those prepared in l979 under military rule, would exhibit greater reliance on domestic, Latin American or Spanish-language programming and correspondingly fewer American- or First World- produced programs; and (2) the programming schedules would  show a trend toward increasingly more use of domestic, Latin American or Spanish-language programming as the Argentine audiences gain more experience with free expression. Findings supported the first hypothesis; however, the second hypothesis was not supported. Findings suggest that further research would benefit from expanding samples to include programming schedules for cities of the country's &quot;interior,&quot; and evaluating the content of Argentina's increasingly widespread cable television system.

Noting that the theory lacks empirical investigation, a study took advantage of a controlled media system in Cheongju, South Korea to examine the theory. Personal interviews of a cross-sectional sample of 287 adults were conducted covering a wide range of topics: interpersonal communication and mass media use, opinions, perceptions of opinion distribution on two social issues, and various demographic questions. Findings suggest that the consonance of media content and the influence of the mass media upon public opinion may have a curvilinear relationship. That  is, as the degree of perceived consonance of media content increases, the media influence upon an individual's perception increases to a certain degree; however, if the degree of consonance exceeds the limit and if individuals notice a high amount of consonance, the influence of mass media on perception may become minimal again.

Respondents were drawn from 10 standard metropolitan statistical areas that are similar in social and demographic characteristics and spread throughout the southeast United States. Randomly selected adolescents and their mothers completed baseline questionnaires in their homes from April through October of 1985. In April through October of 1987, the adolescents and their mothers again completed questionnaires. Only black or white adolescents who provided data for both rounds were included in the tabulation. Results  indicated that white girls who expressed the least stereotyped beliefs about male-female relationships in 1985 spent more time than other white girls watching traditionally male-oriented programs in 1987. Watching female-oriented television in 1985 reduced 1987 sexism scores for white boys and girls, while watching male-oriented programs increased sexism scores for black males. Results revealed the need to view adolescents as active participants in their own sexual socialization. (Four tables of data are included, and 31 references are attached.) (MM)",

The program was implemented in order to profile at-risk adolescents by combining teacher inservice training and curriculum development. Based on certain acceptance criteria, 50 students from each of the district's five senior high schools were selected for participation in this project. Surveys were administered to determine student perceptions and self-reports of school problems and needs, parental relationships and support, and personal views. Results indicate that at-risk student needs and problems would make positive school performance difficult. Ordinary school intervention, such as tutoring and counseling, cannot adequately address these problems. The project  also provided data showing parental cooperation is necessary if any at-risk program is to be effective. (13 references) (SI)",

The CES is a high school reform movement devoted to strengthening the learning of students by reforming each school's priorities and simplifying its structure. The common principles of CES are discussed as well as the methodological issues raised by this CES project: (1) the conditions in schools that suggest this approach; (2) the derivation of the method; (3) the contrasts and tensions between the structure of the first workshops and the structure of ongoing work of the teams in their schools; (4) the issues of ethics and validity by this type of research; (5) the evolving sense of criteria; and (6) the framework  for collaborative action research in restructuring schools. Conclusions indicate that action research and collaboration are important strands of effective reform. Criteria for collaborative action research in schools are: effective team-based approach, productive use of reactivity, development of reflexive processes, involvement of participants in the process, and interaction of action and research in mobilization of information for the change process. Five restructuring diagrams and a copy of a CES brochure are appended. (SI)",

Collective observations of 16 teachers and the author, in an Indiana elementary school over 1 year, identified several distinct forms of social encounters: affirmations are interactions that, while serving to develop and maintain social relationships, can be used to avoid deeper social commitments; onlooking behavior allows the onlooker to interact from a distance with little of the risk associated with more direct participation; tutelar social encounters place one participant as an expert and others as learners; directive situations create a hierarchy, distribute political power among those involved, and deny participants a role in  knowledge creation; involvement in parallel tasks allows freedom to pursue individual interests while retaining the capability of interacting with others; individual social thoughts are responses to the larger, yet not physically present, social community; cooperative social behavior enables a task to be assumed and completed that otherwise (alone) would have been difficult; collaborative interactions reconstruct participants' perceptions to include those insights generated as a group. As educators come to understand and value learning as a social process, the potential for reconceptualization of self-perceptions as teachers and the act of learning is being realized. (KM)",

This report also reviews survey data on the attitudes of teachers and principals toward the value and implementation of the career teaching role and analyzes the potential of a loan forgiveness program for career teachers as a strategy to improve student learning and the attractiveness of teaching careers. Based on survey results, a majority of Minnesota teachers believe that another teaching or administrator role in education could provide more satisfaction than their current teaching jobs. No one alternative teaching role emerged as a clear favorite of  teachers.

        "description":"Today's public schools are failing to educate not only disadvantaged students, but average students as well. The public education system in America faces twin dilemmas: In the current changing national economy and labor market, schools are inadequately preparing students to be self-sufficient adults; and the population of disadvantaged youth is steadily increasing. Suggested reforms by the federal government, magnet schools, and private foundations will do little to alter the structure of the educational system; school-site management, however, has the potential to produce changes. Through school-site management, administrators, teachers, and citizens can make the decisions (and monitor and evaluate their implementation) necessary to reform the education of disadvantaged youth.  Unlike reforms foisted on schools by legislatures or boards, improvements resulting from school-site management would be implemented by the people initiating the reforms. This may be an advantage because reforms potentially would be more realistic, but reform efforts could also founder on the enormity of the task. Foundations can play a valuable role in the implementation of school-site management programs in public schools by supporting programs that are more likely to benefit the students, rather than objective reform that can be more beneficial to decisionmakers.

Section III and a table included at the end of the report present a summary of the results of a survey sent to all state education and human service agencies in an effort to list the current state-level collaborative task force/committees, agreements, and initiatives and scan good examples of collaboration. Forty-eight states and territories responded. The survey and related data show a great deal of cooperative interagency planning.

The study's sample consisted of 60 core curriculum classroom teachers. Their perceptions were gathered by using a six-point Likert-type Delta Technique survey. Comments followed 39 survey statements. Eighty percent of the surveys were returned. Group means were calculated for the responses to statements in  the six OBE-related areas. An analysis of variance and Scheffe tests were conducted on each of the 39 survey statements to determine differences among the groups. The findings revealed that level of teaching assignment was the independent variable cited as showing differences among the groups of respondents for 11 of the statements; level of teaching experience and level of education attained were the area of significant difference for one statement; and years of teaching experience and level of education provided differences for one statement. Recommendations include procedures for staff development programs to address the practical concerns of teachers about their grade level's use of OBE. (Author/JAM)",

Essentially, Network 1's responsibility is to develop and test &quot;participation&quot; indicators on enrollments, educational career paths, and school leavers at different stages of the member countries' educational systems for the ultimate purposes of improving retention in secondary and higher education, enhancing student completion of programs that fit the requisites of the high technology job market, ensuring equality of educational outcomes, and informing governments regarding the educational policy and management of vocational instruction. Specifically, Network 1 offered preliminary assessments of the policy areas where  participation indicators have been or could be of assistance; reviewed the education systems and the data collections of each country; and developed indicator definitions and research methodologies for the indicators. The paper concludes that the Network's overriding interest is to develop participation indicators that are relevant to policy interests and that have sufficient reliability and depth so that they can be used, with confidence, to inform policy decisions. This common interest makes a strong statement about the social and economic pressures on governments around the world to improve their educational systems in terms of access, outcomes, and effectiveness.

Educators are urged to increase graduation rates, start intervention programs early, emphasize parent responsibility, ensure attendance, and increase student academic  achievement. (SI)",

        "author":["Weiler, Hans N."],
        "description":"According to John Friedmann, planning is meant to mediate knowledge and action, providing a conceptual and operational linkage between a certain body of knowledge and a certain set of activities in the policy-making domain. This linkage articulates the knowledge needs of action and informs knowledge by translating and processing pertinent insights gained from perusing available knowledge. The close relationship between knowledge and action in planning makes the planning knowledge base critically important. Whether or not educational planning is in crisis (like mainstream planning), it is linked to a particular knowledge base with its own epistemology and its own set of structural and institutional arrangements for producing and disseminating knowledge. This paper argues that key  elements in the knowledge base are being profoundly challenged at the same time that educational planning is undergoing some major reconfigurations. These challenges derive from an erosion of the philosphical consensus underlying modern social research and from questions raised about the prevailing structural, economic, and political arrangements for knowledge production and dissemination. Also, dissatisfaction with the existing knowledge base is helping to articulate new and different knowledge needs and generate a new knowledge culture. After reviewing the prevailing philosophical premises guiding the conventional knowledge base for educatonal planning, the paper assesses challenges to the philosophical and institutional elements of this knowledge culture. The paper concludes by  speculating on possible concerns for a new educational planning knowledge base. (140 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Every child who enters the doors of the nation's school system deserves an education, including children with AIDS. Parents of AIDS-free children fear that the AIDS-infected child in the classroom threatens the health and safety of the general school community. But according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, casual contact with AIDS patients does not place others at risk of contracting the illness. A child with AIDS is considered handicapped and thus is entitled to all the legal rights that a handicapped student possesses. These rights include the right to receive a free and appropriate education with the same variety of programs and services that children without handicaps enjoy and placement in the least restrictive environment with nonhandicapped children  (mainstreamed) whenever possible. According to the legal community, educators are in direct conflict with the nation's laws if they refuse to educate the AIDS afflicted child; therefore, teachers must comply. If educating, learning, and teaching the whole child--all children--is an educator's goal, then let educators take the initiative and accept the challenge. (14 references) (KM)",

        "description":"&quot;First wave&quot; educational reform has resulted in various state and local incentive and pay-for-performance programs, such as Tennessee's career ladder program offering extended contract opportunities for teachers and administrators achieving a certain performance status. While the intent was to reward excellence, offer supplemental pay through additional employment opportunities, and allow teachers to focus on students' special needs, the present extended contract program did not prove to be an incentive for excellent performance. In response to educator dissatisfaction, the Tennessee General Assembly called for a reexamination of the career ladder program and for development of methods for enhancing extended contract activities. Based on the 1987 study's findings, the 1988  legislation advocated that all future extended contract efforts focus directly on meeting student needs and indirectly on developing appropriate incentives for educators. State directives also charged the study team to explore alternative incentive programs for teachers, schools, and school systems. This report includes the methodology, findings, and recommendations of the 1988 career ladder study as related to extended contracts and alternative incentives; the methodology, findings, and recommendations of the 1988 career study considering alternative options; and the guidelines for alternative incentive programs to be implemented during 1989-90. The 1988 study discloses research on types of incentives (intrinsic and extrinsic) and unit size (individual, group, and organization). The  alternative incentive study recommended: (1) expanding the local educational agency's role; (2) developing an integrated approach; (3) capitalizing on intrinsic incentives; and (4) providing a variety of incentives.

        "description":"To meet growing demands for collecting and using quality information for decision-making, many U.S. school districts are developing database systems that increase their responsiveness to schools and communities. This paper describes how Long Beach Unified School District (California) designed and implemented a Database Management Information System (DBMIS) to improve information collection and use for districtwide planning. The major function of the DBMIS is to collect, accumulate, summarize, analyze, and report information on an annual basis, using 1986-87 as the baseline year from which longitudinal trends will be measured. Student achievement scores and the results of current, specialized Research Office studies will be integrated in the system to form a comprehensive data  bank. Survey methodology will be used to identify areas for further study. Initially, the Research Office formed a steering committee to identify major planning issues to form the foundation of the management information system. Directed by a professional facilitator, the superintendent and committee identified issues categorized into eight major goal areas. Using these goals as a framework, the Research Office developed a bank of items to aid construction of district surveys. Ten items were then selected to address planning issues such as year-round schooling, job satisfaction, involvement in decision-making, facilities upkeep, and personnel issues. A second bank of 345 survey items was developed to assess school effectiveness variables influencing student achievement. In fall 1986 each  school developed customized surveys for staff, students, and parents designed to meet that school's information and program needs. Survey methodology and findings are briefly summarized. Four figures and 11 tables are included. (MLH)",

        "description":"After discussing the need for second-order (or structural) reform and Tennessee's leadership in &quot;first wave&quot; legislation, this paper describes selected aspects of Tennessee reform activities and recent events leading to client-centered control. Tennessee's Better Schools Program, consistent with &quot;first-wave&quot; proposals, emphasized greater control and increased teacher accountability. The program was best known for its career ladder program, which began in 1984 and featured an extended contract program component. A 1987 study of 600 teachers and 100 administrators found that monetary reward was the primary incentive for participating in the career ladder program and that teachers cited more deleterious than beneficial effects of the program. Also, there was little agreement  concerning program goals and purposes. The extended contract component suffered from inconsistent funding procedures, lack of agreement concerning alternative routes to career ladder status, and lack of awareness of incentives to enhance teaching and improve the workplace. The 1987 study recommended that future Tennessee reform efforts develop clearly stated goals that are feasible, useful, and beneficial to students. The paper then summarizes some 1988 studies comprising Tennessee's refocused reform efforts. These include studies in teacher evaluation, needs assessment, extended contracts, alternative incentives, and quality of school life. Current status and future research directions are briefly outlined. (50 references) (MLH)",

The program serves mildly handicapped (learning disabled and mildly retarded) secondary level students in 18 regular vocational education courses delivered in 45 middle, junior high, and senior high schools in DoDDS schools in Germany. CBVA assessment forms for 1,811 students were completed by 317 teachers, job placement coordinators, or work site supervisors. The project found that special education students were rated in the upper quartile for all 21 work-related behaviors indicating positive social adaptability in this setting. Performance on generalized employability skills was mixed with students average or better in  applying academic skills to vocational instruction but was less proficient in categories related to employer-employee relationships. Vocational teachers indicated that extra assistance was routinely provided, with proficiency levels dramatically improved by such assistance. Results are reported both textually and graphically with findings separated by sex and by grades 6-8 and grades 9-12 for the following categories: grouped work related behaviors; grouped generalized employability outcomes; occupational skills outcomes; interest/aptitude; individual work related behaviors; and individual generalized employability outcomes. Additional charts present results on teacher assistance for the same categories. (DB)",

Videotapes of social interactions were evaluated for behaviors suggesting imitation, dominance, agonism, and prosocial behavior. Children's mothers completed questionnaires related to their perception of the siblings' relationships, family resources, stress, support and functioning, and demographic information. Statistically significant findings for siblings of handicapped children included relations with age (older children displayed greater dominance); relations with birth order (older siblings imitated less and were  more prosocial); and relations with age gap (greater age gaps were associated with greater dominance). Siblings of control children exhibited significantly more prosocial behavior but did not differ from siblings of handicapped children on imitation, dominance, or agonism. Gender differences were not found. Maternal questionnaire data indicated that family cohesiveness was negatively related to agonism, family size was positively related to prosocial behaviors. Separate analyses by handicapping condition found that siblings of Down syndrome children displayed the greatest dominance and Down syndrome children were most agonistic.

        "description":"The paper describes the effects of a communication training program provided at the DEAL Communicaton Center Victoria, Australia, to 34 clients with diagnoses of autism or intellectual impairment with autistic tendencies. Client ages ranged from preschool to adult with 24 aged between 6 and 18 years. The treatment module consists of three 2-hour sessions with most clients receiving more than one module. Assessment utilized a highly motivating voice-output computer. Training involved physical hands-on guidance by the trainer with the ultimate goal of fully independent communication using any appropriate strategy (speech, sign, communication displays, or spelling.) Nine of the group attained fluent independent communication by spelling with an additional 14 communicating well with  facilitation. Some spelling clients use voice output communication aids and most use mini-typewriters or small alphabet boards. Manual signing and finger spelling is used by only one client. The most time consuming aspect of the training was generalization to other communication partners and locations. Results have implications for the diagnosis and prognosis of persons who are mistakenly identified as autistic but have neurological damage which interferes with free expression. (DB)",

Examples of advance organizers include the expository advance organizer, the comparative advance organizer, the graphic advance organizer, and principles as advance organizers. The review concludes that analysis of well-designed studies offers tentative support for the advance organizer technique if the material to be learned is not well-organized to begin with and if students have limited prior knowledge of the subject. The lack of research using advance organizers with students with disabilities is noted. Suggestions are then offered for use of the technique with learning disabled  students; suggestions include understanding the distinction between advance organizers and overviews, not using them if the material is already well organized, the greater usefulness of advance organizers when material is presented verbally, and the value of writing the organizer on the blackboard if used with a verbal presentation. It is suggested that advance organizers may help learning disabled students learn to organize information for themselves. (Author/DB)",

A marketing approach was used which showed that employers considered such worker characteristics as good work habits, work attitudes, and interpersonal skills to be critical to occupational stability. It also showed that employers consider a worker who has previously developed the critical traits to be easier to retrain because retraining can focus on vocational skill specific to the new  job.

The paper describes the Taxonomy of Community Living Skills, an organized statement of instructional goals to aid in curriculum development for persons with mental retardation. The goals are organized into five domains: (1) Homemaking and Community Life, (2) Vocational, (3) Leisure, (4) Personal Maintenance and Development, and (5) Travel. The taxonomy provides lists of skills for each of the major goals. In addition each domain has a list of potential \"glitches\" with which everyone must learn to cope (e.g., missing the bus). Results  of a review of the taxonomy by 59 experts in instruction of the retarded are detailed and indicate that they perceived the taxonomy as a potentially useful document. Twenty-one references are listed. (DB)",

The  Critical Functions Profile identifies functions necessary to produce required results and also provides a record of the job coach's time commitment. Employers complete the Employer Concern Form frequently to identify social and work performance problems or deficiencies as early as possible. The Employer Rating Scale is a summative instrument requiring comparison of the mentally retarded worker to others doing the same or similar jobs.

Questions were concerned with parental perceptions of the following: desirability of various after school placements, concerns about vocational training problems, the importance of various types of training in the last 2 years of public school, how much school time should be devoted to vocational training, the desirability of their children eventually working, ideas about the type of work their  children should perform, appropriate wages during and after training. Results indicated that, as a group, parents wanted their children to go to work someday, but lack information about the available options. Parents wanted their children to have vocational training but were not willing to give up academic training while their children were still in school. Many parents feared their children would be mistreated during work training and/or performance. Parents tended to assume that their children would go to the sheltered workshop rather than into community jobs. (DB)",

The objective of this phase was to establish and try methodological procedures. The overall study's objectives are to provide basic data, by case study, about the quality of the educational and social experiences of these populations and to determine factors relevant to child, classroom, and school associated with successful academic, social, and physical integration. Child factors examined  include demographic characteristics, disability type, scholastic achievement, personal/social adjustment, cognitive level, extracurricular activities, and parental attitudes to and degree of support for integration. Classroom factors include teacher's instructional style, instructional appropriateness, time management, attitudes toward integration, average time on task for the class, and classroom climate. School factors include use of support services, school ethos, type of school organization, and staff attitudes toward integration.

The reliability and validity of a parental screening instrument based on the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale was investigated with a sample of 2,783 Swedish children out of a population of 3,245. In order to establish concurrent validity, the children with scores in the lowest two percent were tested with the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale; correlation with parental assessment was .87. To determine the predictive validity of the assessment, children were screened for mental retardation and other learning disabilities at 8 and 14 years. A comparison of parental assessment scores and test scores of low-scorers at  18 months with follow-up results showed that the two assessment methods yielded a similar prediction rate of 65 percent. However, follow-up studies also revealed false positives among low-scoring children identified at 18 months; reasons for this are discussed. It is concluded that parents are able assessors of development if they are provided with an instrument developed for that purpose. (JDD)",

Student leaders' roles in schools can also, however, be benevolent, leading to both personal development and school/community development. In schools for blacks in South Africa, black power and student power may combine to form black student power. Educators should acknowledge the presence of student power, identify student leaders properly, develop their leadership potential, and give them scope to exercise their leadership in order that student leaders become a benevolent force in their school communities. Leadership potential and ability as a manifestation of giftedness is recognized universally in definitions of giftedness, but leadership development is  often neglected. A pyramid-chart illustrates the delineation of levels of students in need of leadership education, accompanied by an inverted pyramid diagram which represents the quantity and content of leadership education needed for each corresponding level. Opportunities should be created to develop student leadership potential through such activities as student councils, committees, class captains, bus captains, etc. The J. F. A. Swartz Educational Leadership Project is described as an ad hoc project of the University of Stellenbosch (South Africa) which presents leadership seminars for student leaders and educators. (JDD)",

While the Verbal-Comprehension and Perceptual-Organizational factors significantly distinguished between clinic groups, the FFD factor did not. A predictive discriminate analysis revealed very low hit rates using the WISC-R factors, but, using a battery of selected neurocognitive measures of attention, memory, self-regulation, and speed of cognitive processing, good group discrimination was achieved. These results  argue against using the WISC-R FFD factor in differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders and suggests that other combinations of neuropsychological measures provide better indices for distinguishing clinic groups of ADD/H children.

The subjects were 63 native-Hebrew-speaking students enrolled in English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) courses at the Seminar Hakibbutzim Teacher Training College in Tel Aviv (Israel). The subjects were given two sets of instructions (guided and minimal) for summarizing texts in both English and Hebrew. The guided instructions gave specific directions on how to read the texts and on how to write the summaries, while the minimal instructions gave traditional minimum direction. Two scoring keys were developed from the summaries of nine Hebrew-speaking and nine English-speaking experts, respectively. The summary guidelines developed in this case did not make a sizable  contribution to summary development, but an item-by-item analysis revealed that the guided instructions were both helpful and detrimental. In some cases, the guided instructions helped respondents to identify key elements to summarize, but in other cases, they may have dissuaded the respondents from including details that in fact proved essential in the eyes of the experts upon whom the rating key was based.

The techniques being implemented model the cognitive skills underlying foreign language competence by using computational linguistic models and semantic networks built into hypertext systems. It is proposed that these techniques could be useful for assessing basic language competence. Aspects of the research and related technology are examined: intelligent tutoring systems, the expert model and second  language learning, student (trainee) models and language aptitude testing, the pedagogical model, the knowledge base, the interface, hypertext systems and command menus, smart computer-assisted language learning environments, grammars and grammar representations, parsing strategies, using grammars for computer-assisted language learning, use and adaptation of specific software packages, immersion techniques, and semantic mapping.

The current study focuses on the methodological problems in establishing an \"episode\" in which English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learners use the internally bound IL contexts that they have developed. Video- and audio-taped sessions of language interaction between a native-Chinese-speaking graduate student teaching mathematics and his students were used as primary data. Secondary data consisted of commentary on these interactions by the students in his class (coparticipants) and by  subject-specialist informants. It is maintained that the student-informant insights come out of the internally-created discourse domains that are the initiators of second language acquisition. (DJD)",

Linguistic issues arise in courts when lawyers attempt to convince a court that a statute, insurance policy, or contract should be interpreted as favoring their own client's interests, with respect to resolving a dispute that depends on the proper construal of a particular document. An examination of what judges say about linguistics and about their role as linguists casts some light on the judicial process. It is maintained that linguistic principles do not operate as the courts claim they do. Moreover, disputes exist even among judges in the same court about both the proper characterization of linguistic rules and their relevance to the decisionmaking process. The &quot;last antecedent rule&quot; is discussed in its application to a  California case, &quot;Anderson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (1969).&quot; The linguistic processing strategies used with the &quot;last antecedent rule&quot; are also described, and rules governing the interpretation of &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot; are reviewed.

        "author":["Valimaa-Blum, Riitta"],
        "description":"It is proposed in this paper that there are two rules involved in Finnish vowel harmony--prescriptive and descriptive. The prescriptive rule requires a back vowel in the suffix whenever there is a back vowel in the root; the descriptive rule lets the value of the last non-neutral vowel spread to the suffix and additionally involves an analysis of long loan words into prosodic compounds. In the autosegmental framework, the former rule treats all front vowels as neutral in the harmonic process while the later follows the &quot;native line&quot; and there are only two neutral vowels. The neutral vowels get their front value by segmental prespecification. The suffix vowels left unspecified after spreading have their front-value by a late default rule. This default rule is supported by the fact  that epenthetic vowels in Finnish are [-back]. It has been suggested that consonant gradation in Finnish has become semasiologized as it has divided the lexicon into strata characterized by specific functional-stylistic valencies. It is concluded that the two vowel harmony rules have done the same; they divide the lexicon in two, and the alternating cases codify socially significant information. (DJD)",

The traditional rule, the rule for forming the past tense of regular verbs in English, is discussed as it relates to language acquisition in children. It is proposed that children go through three stages in the learning of the regular past tense: (1) the past tense of the words, or amalgams, are learned by rote; (2) the amalgams are associated by means of a schema; and (3) a categorical rule is constructed. The stages, proposed by Bybee and Slobin, identify schema as the missing link between amalgams and categorical rules. In a language  acquisition study completed within the variationist framework, a pattern of language acquisition in subject-verb inversion of Wh- questions was isolated and three similar stages were followed, including: (1) formulaic patterns; (2) a variable rule; and (3) a categorical rule. The radial category hypothesis is proposed to satisfy the assertion that variation in child language development can be a prototype effect resulting from the prototype nature of a partially constructed grammatical category.

A study focusing on the discontinuous idiom chunks of possessive object (POBJ) construction produced the unexpected result that even though head-wrapping is a syntactic operation introduced to account for discontinuous constituencies, POBJ data cannot be accounted for with the Head-wrap mechanisms. The adoption of Head-wrap operations as the only explanation of discontinuous constituencies predicts that one of the disjoint sub-strings  must have the head of the entire constituent on its edge. The validity of Head-wrap as the mechanism for accounting for the discontinuity of syntax is challenged by the fact that the frequency/duration adverbial splits the POBJ predicate non-adjacent to the head. The failure of grammars with head-wrapping to produce a straightforward syntactic solution to the POBJ data calls for a closer examination of non-syntactic approaches. (MSE)",

The core/peripheral distinction has direct implications for grammatical development in children. The effects of the core/periphery distinction in actual language acquisition are explored, and it is suggested that this theoretical distinction explains a number of properties of real-time acquisition. It is demonstrated that core and peripheral aspects of grammar are acquired differently and that the latter poses a more substantial learning problem for the child. The evidence considered comes from the acquisition of inflectional morphology.  Acquisition of verbal inflection is discussed, proposing that the variability in the grammatical status of inflection across languages accounts for its relative ease or difficulty of acquisition. The second section addresses markedness and acquisition, drawing on evidence from agrammatic aphasics that supports the analysis of inflection proposed earlier. (MSE)",

Reading time and response times to probe and comprehension questions were recorded. Results showed that the responses to the binding probe, when the sentence contained a verbal passive, were different from responses to the same probe in the other two constructions, suggesting that the language processor treats verbal  passives differently from superficially similar adjectives and adjectival passives. The direction of the effect is consistent with a government binding analysis of verbal passives that incorporate noun phrase movement and bound trace.

The formal concomitants of the sequence constructions are the order of the constituents and the accentual pattern. Thus, the same formal constituents in different combinations realize different constructions. The implicit claim is that sentences are not interpreted just against their context, but that the constructions themselves  encode the pragmatics of their use. The analysis begins with a discussion of the traditional views of Finnish word order and proceeds to illustrate what pragmatic values word order encodes, how word order interacts with various kinds of definiteness, and how the partitive subject interacts with definiteness.

        "description":"The issue of discrimination against Asian-Americans in higher education is discussed. The focus is on: whether certain of the country's most prestigious universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants; why this occurs; and what university officials, executive branch administrators, and members of Congress can do about it. Suspicions arise because university admissions committees tend to be extremely vague about the impact of race on their acceptance/rejection decisions. Though minority status can add 40 to 50 percentage points to an applicant's chance of admission, such racial preferences generally do not operate in favor of Asian-Americans and are often quite the opposite. Statistical evidence shows these candidates face higher hurdles than academically less  qualified candidates of other races. One study shows the cultural bias and stereotypes that prevail in the admission office work to the detriment of Asian-American applicants. Rejection of such applicants appears to be driven by university affirmative action policies aimed at favoring other, preferred racial minorities. Thus, where admissions policies are primarily merit-based, Asian-Americans will in all likelihood be accepted in numbers that far outstrip their percentage share of the general population. Three suggestions for action are: universities should continue to their self-scrutiny; the Department of Justice and Department of Education must play major roles; and Congress should be a major player in the effort to root out and bring to a halt any unlawful discriminatory admission  policies at U.S. colleges and universities.

In general, American College Testing Program (ACT) scores predicted success better for associate degree students than for baccalaureate students. Grade point average in clinical nursing courses and the Mosby Assess Test appeared to be good predictors of success on NCLEX-RN for baccalaureate students. No formal research was found using the Nelson-Denny reading exam as a predictor of baccalaureate nursing success. Other than the verbal scores of the Scholastic Aptitude Tests and the ACT, none of the  research used reading comprehension ability or nursing vocabulary as variables in either identifying at-risk students or predicting NCLEX-RN success. Most studies agreed that pre-admission criteria are useful for admission decisions and upholding admission standards but should not be used to prevent at-risk students from having a chance of being admitted. There is a consensus that at-risk students should be identified early and given assistance, but the exact type of assistance and who the provider should be have not been determined.

        "description":"In response to increasing incidents of racism on college campuses, an undergraduate course was developed to facilitate learning about racial relationships in a proactive manner. While universities promote student development in many ways through the formal and informal curriculum, aspects of social, emotional and ethical growth are generally viewed as the responsibility of student life divisions. This course represented an effort to merge the concerns of the academic and university life communities with a learning experience that would facilitate emotional and intellectual growth. The course included traditional academic requirements as well as an experiential component, in which undergraduates collaborated with graduate students and ethnic minority middle-school students in  conducting field research and in facilitating career development discussion groups in an urban middle school. Of the two class meetings per week, one was held at the university and involved critical discussion among the undergraduates of the literature on youth unemployment. The second class session each week was held at the middle school and involved career development discussion in groups, each group consisting of two or three middle school students, one undergraduate and one graduate student (in Counseling Psychology). Undergraduates were also responsible for keeping a journal, collaborating on a field research project, and preparing a literature review and final report on the area of field research. Pre and post-course questionnaires (completed by the undergraduate and graduate  students, middle school students and school administrators) suggested that this course assisted undergraduates in dispelling some stereotypical images and in developing feelings of increased competence and decreased anxiety in interacting with ethnic minority youth.

        "description":"A review was conducted of what the military services have done to determine the extent to which military physicians perform routine administrative and clerical tasks, and what the services have done to solve the problem. It was found that there is general agreement within the Department of Defense (DOD) and the military services that physicians are performing clerical and administrative tasks and that this detracts from clinical practice time and adversely affects physician productivity. Although the full extent of the administrative support problem and its effects are unknown, DOD health care professionals generally agree that it is a serious matter requiring priority attention. Each service has initiated or planned various actions to address the issue, but the impact of these  actions may not be felt for a long time. The following topics are included: (1) background, objectives, scope and methodology of the review; (2) DOD and the services recognize the problem; (3) services' attempts to define the problem (Army, Navy, and Air Force); (4) DOD efforts to deal with the administrative support issue; and (5) conclusion. It is noted that providing adequate staff support could be a long-term project requiring multi-year budgetary commitments as well as monitoring to ensure effective implementation. (KM)",

        "description":"Institutional responsibility for assisting underprepared students was discussed in a caucus session. Four questions were addressed as follows: (1) to what extent should colleges and universities be responsible for ameliorating academic deficiencies among high risk students? (2) should separate facilities be established to serve high risk students, or can their needs be met by existing offices and staff position? (3) how can student development professionals meet the counseling needs of these students? and (4) are there steps college and university personnel can be taking to improve academic preparation at the elementary, middle, and high school levels? The consensus among participants in the caucus was that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education to  ameliorate academic deficiencies, and this responsibility does not rest solely with community colleges and other open access institutions. A college or university is responsible for providing those support services necessary to facilitate the success of the students it recruits. While separate facilities and programs may stigmatize high risk students, they may be more likely to serve all the needs of the underprepared. Counselors and advisors can more effectively meet the needs of underprepared students by creating programs which foster the development of the whole person rather than limiting themselves to traditional academic concerns. College and university personnel can reach down to provide programs which enhance skill development and promote positive attitudes toward education among  younger students. Contains 81 references.

        "description":"Important steps for saving America's school system where at-risk students are fast becoming the new student majority are discussed. For example: 45% of all Mexican American and Puerto Rican youth never finish high school; illiteracy among minority students is as high as 40%; and between 1968 and 1986, the number of white children enrolled in public schools fell 16%. About 30% of the school population was minority in 1986. A Los Angeles (California) study shows as early as the first 2 weeks of first grade, students are categorized as fast or slow learners, and some who do not speak English are misdiagnosed. Once this decision is made, students in slow groups are educated quite differently. Minority students usually attend segregated schools with crowded classes and poor counseling. The impact of this crisis on higher education is enormous. High dropout rates greatly reduce the number of minority students qualified to enter college. Differential tracking in school leads many minority students to enroll in vocational, commercial, or general education programs. Higher education remains an unrealized dream for most minorities. Though college access is available via community colleges, fewer and fewer students are actually transferring out of them. Hope for the at-risk freshman depends on the amount that administrators, faculty, and counselors do to encourage, assist, and support them to survive the college experience. Faculty must take time to learn about minority cultures and must include minority perspectives in the classroom. They must set high  expectations and help students reach them. Contains 8 references.

The subjects were from the 1985 entering freshman class. Intensive interviews were conducted with each student, and content analysis of the interviews was the method used to analyze the data. Emerging from the anecdotal, self-reported data were the common experiences relating to the persistence of Mexican American students at the university. Data divide naturally into the areas of personal behaviors and problems and institutional behaviors and problems. Only summary findings from the personal area are reviewed. Several categories relating to personal behaviors were determined (human  support, financial adversity commitment, and gender differences). Findings include the following: (1) in the area of familial support, a method is needed to involve the parents in the students' education so they can develop an understanding of the challenge their child faces and (2) in the area of financial adversity there is a need for education on the meaning of financial aid and its availability. Many of the experiences noted are particular to minority groups; (for example, most have parents who are blue collar workers, and many college females have the double burden of schoolwork and pressure to marry or work while attending school while their brothers have all expenses paid).

        "description":"Information is presented on a study to explore similarities and differences among adults in their perceptions of attributes associated with exemplary instruction. Three purposes were to: determine how returning adults describe the instructors they find exemplary and compare these findings with the findings of previous research about younger student perceptions; explore similarities and differences in perceptions; and use the findings to generate propositions for further study. Bases of comparison were gender, age, level of study, subject matter, profession, and stage in professional career. A content analysis was done on 176 letters of recommendation received from adult students in an excellence in off-campus teaching award program at a large midwestern research university.  Content analysis yielded 971 data elements in 28 categories focusing on instructional techniques, instructor-student relationships, course outcomes, instructor as a person, and instructor professionalism. Much commonality was found between characteristics of excellent instruction reported by adult students and those reported by traditional undergraduate students from other studies. Findings suggest students' expectations of instructors arise from the interaction of such factors as content studied, student status, and personal situation. Common patterns of normative evaluations or expectations can be extended via the additive and diversifying experiences of adulthood. Also, these common patterns can be modified through the particular experiences of academic preparation and adulthood.  Tables are included. Contains 17 references. (Author/SM)",

Its goals were: to identify the success rate of women relative to the proportion of their representation in higher education; to identify and characterize any emerging alternative career pathways in colleges and universities; to compare the success rate for position types of internal candidates with external candidates; and to determine if the hiring procedures reflect changing policies. In this study, 1,610 administrative positions were categorized according to type of position, type of institution, and sources of appointee. Results indicate that hiring committees review candidates' papers in search of credential rather than competence, and this is a disadvantage for anyone who has not had the  accumulated time-in-line experience. Data indicate there has been no significant change in the percent of successful female candidates for employment in mainline administration over the past decade, though there is evidence that females are increasingly successful in entering higher education administration via alternative routes. Administrative mobility through accrued responsibility is an emerging phenomenon within higher education. Females are particularly successful with the process among private institutions of higher education. The implications of this practice for professionals attempting to enter higher education administration through alternative routes is less than positive. Tables are included. Contains 23 references.

Continuous negotiation between university presidents and faculty members is explained. Presentation of the budget to the college community is examined, noting how the president may use the event to define hard times for the faculty. Features of the president's budgetary communication that encourage or discourage the faculty to accept his or her definition are noted. Both colleges used in the study have similar forms of control, and their presidents have comparable experience. They communicate with their faculties about the budget in diverse ways with budgetary messages differing in substance and form. President A introduces a critical financial  problem with a broad-ranging explanation of background, detailed description of actors, and open-ended but defined set of possible endings. President B gives the message by focusing on the situation as it exists in the present, describing the current context with detailed quantitative measures, depicting financial dynamics in inanimate terms, and ending with an open-ended question about the college's financial future. If the president does not give an interpretation of the frightening event, it will result in ambiguity, discomfort, and a faculty in search of efficacy. Several considerations for administrators include: when presenting the budget to the faculty, interpretation is needed; a clear, plain story is more effective than a polished business report; and the president is likely to  be an important internal actor during times of resource stress.

Questions about the success of John Dawkins, Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in regard to higher education are raised (why he has been successful and what results may last). The main elements of Dawkins reform agenda include: consolidation of institutions via amalgamation to form larger units; abolition of the binary system and replacement by a unified national system of higher education; more emphasis on fields of importance to economic recovery and growth (i.e. applied and computer science and business); and changes to governing bodies to make them more like boards of companies. The  Dawkins approach with an international context fits closely with directions being followed by higher education systems in other industrialized western nations. In 18 months, John Dawkins has made impressive progress toward his goals. The binary system is officially gone, several institutions have been part of mergers, and new growth is being funded at improved rates per student unit. Dawkins is putting renewed energy into achieving his objectives, and he has gained cooperation of the relevant Ministers in the two largest states. Relations between the federal government and the higher education community remain important, and the Dawkins reform agenda has secured strong support, though there is evidence of a change of mood.

The argument is that the various major attempts to restructure Australian education systems both in centralizing and decentralizing forces have gained new strength, and that the recent stated policies of ministers and governments for increased decentralization often have been largely unsuccessful because of the strength of new centralizing forces, often not anticipated or perhaps properly understood even by key policymakers themselves. The result is often considerable frustration and disappointment. A theoretical look is taken at the terms of centralization and decentralization and related concepts. Centralization and  decentralization in relation to the various major attempts of the past decade to restructure state school systems are discussed. Themes of centralization and decentralization in relation to recent attempts by the Federal Minister for Employment, Education, and Training (John Dawkins) to restructure Australian higher education are explored. It is suggested that a new theory to explain why the forces of centralization are strong is needed. Such a theory would take into account new currents within the education sector and forces which derive from major social and political changes outside. Contains 13 references. (SM)",

The primary focus is a description of the development of action research in the middle part of this century in the United States. Certain assumptions, intentions, and practices of educational action research as they emerged in the early stages of development are explained. Some central aspects of educational action research, both in the present and in earlier areas, are identified. Areas of focus include the following: democracy, social engineering, and social change; research for re-education; curriculum studies and the science of education; growing up in educational practice; the method of science; depoliticizing action research; inservice and personal development; persistent themes in  action research; and understanding action research today. Though action research declined in prominence in the late 1950s, it remained consistent. In the 1970s action research continued in several areas. The strongest theme is the idea of the teacher as researcher. Other themes in many of the recent action research projects are the knowledge-practice gap, issues of race, class, and gender, demographic changes in the school population, and school-based alternative models for curriculum development.

        "description":"A survey was conducted of a sample of 716 well-qualified students who sent their American College Testing Program (ACT) scores to the University of Michigan but subsequently did not apply for admission. Telephone interviews resulted in 574 completed interviews, for an 80% response rate. The interview instrument elicited information regarding the colleges these students considered, their ratings of these schools relative to an &quot;ideal&quot; college, their sources of information, and the key factors influencing their decisions to send scores and not to apply. The findings suggest that these decisions are a function of the student's level of interest in a college, desire to keep options open, information-gathering activities, and expectations regarding the college's response upon  receiving the scores. A model of this stage of the college choice process is proposed. Contains 11 references. (Author/KM)",

The best predictors of 5-year graduation were persistence to the second year and first-year cumulative grade-point average. Among pre-college variables, the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and high school rank predicted graduation poorly, and the inclusion of achievement test information increased the multiple correlation by only a small amount. Other demographic variables improved the prediction somewhat, with math-related variables contributing the most.

To determine the items considered important in making personnel decisions in extension and service areas, a survey was sent to chief academic officers in 84 land-grant and research universities. Response rate was 73% (from 43 states). Responses concerning importance of activities and measures of effectiveness are discussed. Seventy-eight percent of respondents agreed with the statement &quot;on this campus, some extension faculty allege they have less opportunity for promotion, tenure or salary raises than do instructional/research faculty,&quot; but half considered this to be a problem  of perception rather than reality. Several steps are suggested to ameliorate this perception, including dissemination of comparative data, discussion of measures of performance, and a clear mutual understanding of expectations.

Findings include: presidents all agree their role in public relations and institutional advancement must be high for the institution to be successful with constituencies; they feel their  role in fund raising is very high; up to 96% of them are very willing to meet with governors, state executive branch members, and congressional representatives; and 85% desire a high degree of involvement in the overall advancement program. Fifteen recommendations include: chair the planning committee and involve advancement staff members; abstain from personal involvement in time intensive projects; and hire and retain the best professionals in the field.

The assumption of donor rationality together with explicit consideration of interorganizational relationships offers a coherent framework for the analysis of voluntary support by the major donor-groups. Support by alumni and non-alumni individuals and business corporations is specifically isolated, and support by all other sources is combined in another category. Although the various donor groups sometimes act in a consistent manner, more often donor behavior is best understood on a subgroup basis. Institutional size is of importance to most donor groups, and institutional quality is of significance to all groups, save alumni, who  respond to more institutional prestige and the financial difficulty of their alma mater. Current institutional efforts at fund raising appear to be primarily reactive in nature. Long-standing ties to institutions are of importance to most donor groups. The various groups who contribute to American research universities act in a manner largely predictable from theory. Economic organizations tend to react primarily in rational economic fashion, whereas the emotives of private individuals have a clearly human dimension as well. Contains 19 references. (SM)",

Six sections include: the coming of age of microcomputers: a growing challenge to planning in postsecondary education (profound change and challenge, environmental factors, and the purpose of this report); trends and issues (technology, management concerns, and government involvement); planning and use of microcomputers in postsecondary education: a national survey (policies for purchasing and using microcomputers, policymakers and decisionmakers, selection criteria for hardware and  software, use of microcomputers, and financial and other commitments); planning process (muddling through, the reactive process, traditional long-range planning, environmental scanning, strategic planning, and tactical planning); examples of institutional planning (Brown University, Clarkson University, Drew University, Drexel University, University of Iowa, Lehigh University, Princeton University, and Stevens Institute of Technology); and conclusions and recommendations (a clear need, operating assumptions, recommendations, and judgments). Ten specific recommendations include: use strategic planning as the most appropriate planning model; involve all faculty and staff in planning the institution's information system and build institutionwide support; and aim for synergy.

        "description":"As college costs continue to soar, families across America are confronting a financial burden they find difficult if not impossible to manage alone. Existing programs like student loans are unable to address a problem of this scope. The search for a method to encourage savings for college without drawing on limited public resources has led to a new investment idea: prepayment of tuition. Although difficult to implement, prepayment plans have the potential to totally restructure higher education finance. The principal advantages of state, national, and commercial savings plans are reviewed, then compared with state and national prepayment plans. Helping families save for higher education is a crucial issue facing policy makers and higher education officials. If parents can be  encouraged to create &quot;new&quot; savings for future college expenses, higher education will benefit while the nation's perilously low savings rate will be transfused. National and commercial savings plans offer alternatives, although somewhat unsatisfactorily. A well-structured national prepayment plan is essential in order to bring the nation's college tuition crisis in check. Contains four references. (SM)",

This service has taken many forms over the years, from folding bandages for soldiers at war, to providing tutorial services for elementary and secondary school children, to staffing medical programs in Appalachia. It encompasses paid and non-paid positions, internships or other work resulting in academic credit, and community service. Today, it may also affect student financial and related legislation. In recent years, college students have been described as narcissistic and part of the &quot;me generation,&quot; and one study indicates a shift from civic responsibility to self-interest. There are signs, however, that current undergraduates are more altruistic, and  institutional initiatives to support student volunteerism are increasing. Direct methods of encouraging student volunteerism are being considered and include an institutional or governmental community service requirement and a financial aid program linked to community service. Several successful programs to encourage undergraduates to volunteer are cited. Proposals under consideration for relating such work to financial aid are as follows: make eligibility grants and loan forgiveness dependent upon volunteer service; resurrect the G.I. Bill, with modifications; and enact legislation linking financial aid eligibility to national youth service programs. Contains 12 references. (SM)",

Computer use can help faculty and students establish new patterns of sharing data, and computer aided relationships built around specific question and answer data can influence their frequency of contact. The computer is good for making instructional management more efficient. Its question and answer model lets faculty members become process centered expediters. Part-time teaching performance affects the institution's overall quality of academic progress. Institutional excellence includes faculty that combines part-time  professionals with the core full-timers. Issues regarding part-time faculty involve status, use, workload, evaluation, support, and compensation. Colleges and universities must specify employment requirements for part-time faculty who meet the standards established by accrediting agencies. Recruitment strategy (integrating marketing and faculty involvement) is inclusive and involves all members of the campus community. The campus community must look at: where they are; where they want to go; and how they can develop an information system to keep them informed. The college/university mission must be rethought. Faculty involvement is critical to make the plan reflect the institution's academic mission. Institutional health is diagnosed on the basis of enrollment, and marketing is the common  prescription for health. Contains 23 references. (SM)",

Rather than acting as a single prototype this report provides information about various models to individual faculties that must decide the undergraduate course of study. The results of a 1989 survey funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and conducted by the Gallup Organization are discussed, noting that significant gaps exist in college seniors' knowledge of history and literature. Too many colleges and universities fail to provide enough structure in the curriculum.  Since many of them allow students to earn bachelor's degrees without taking courses in history, literature, science, or mathematics, trustees and administrators are urged to support faculty members working to strengthen general education requirements. To deal with this problem, a core of learning is set forth as follows: 50 semester hours of required study in cultures and civilizations, foreign languages, mathematics, natural sciences and the social sciences. Several examples of core courses that have been developed at colleges and universities nationwide are included. It is recommended that courses in the core be taught in small classes and in an integrated fashion and that they be taught by the most distinguished faculty.

        "description":"This paper summarizes the theoretical basis of the relationship between preconceptions and the construct of mental effort in order to identify factors that researchers have shown to influence mental effort, and to suggest an agenda for future research in this area. It begins with a discussion of the theoretical bases of the relationship between preconceptions and mental effort which reviews and summarizes four theories of cognition and motivation: (1) reactive theory; (2) active processing theories; (3) curiosity theory; and (4) attribution theory. It is also noted that past experiences, perceptions of the task, and characteristics of the media may each contribute to the preconceptions that learners bring to an instructional setting, and may in turn influence the invested mental  effort. The paper then describes research on preconceptions and mental effort in the specific areas of learner preconceptions; mental effort and learning; the influence of the perceived task on mental effort; and the influence of characteristics of the media on mental effort. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, which include measuring the delay time in responding to some secondary task while attending to the primary task of reading or viewing the stimulus material; studying the role of embedded post-questions in text using a secondary task technique to measure the amount of cognitive capacity used during processing; and using other methods to increase the cognitive capacity used in processing a text-based lesson.

        "author":["Grabinger, R. Scott"],
        "description":"This report discusses the current state of research into the visual effects of screen layout design, i.e., the arrangement of design elements on a screen. First, two types of design elements are described: technical (those things that engineers work with and that users have little or no control over), and comprehensibility (those elements that a designer, publisher, or programmer can control). Next, two types of research involving the study of the effects of screen design--single and multiple element research--are examined. A number of problems related to studies of the overall appearance of a screen and its effect on learner preferences are then reviewed in relation to &quot;macroprocesses,&quot; or the processes and activities a student uses to learn. Conclusions drawn from these studies  indicate that the overall visual design of the screen has little effect on macroprocesses, and that the research methodologies and measures employed are not sensitive enough to measure the effects of macroprocesses. It is argued that what is necessary is more precise concentration on the effects of screen designs on learner actions and processes, rather than focusing only on the major effects of learning. Two examples of research in this area are briefly described, and a number of dependent variables in investigating the visual effect of screen designs are proposed. (21 references) (CGD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effect of graphic format--bar, line, table, and line-table graph--on the interpretation of numerical data by field dependent and field independent students. Ninety-six undergraduate students were given the Group Embedded Figures Test and randomly assigned to one of four treatments. During the testing phase, the subjects were given a fictitious narrative concerning income amounts of various European merchants during the Middle Ages and shown the quantitative data in one of the graphic formats on a 35mm slide; the order of the questions was randomly altered for each treatment. All subjects in all treatments responded to the same questions, each of which required a numerical or verbal answer as either a specific amount or a static or dynamic  comparison of the data. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test the research hypothesis. Results indicated that scores were lower for the line graph treatment than for the table treatment for all three types of questions. Subjects viewing the bar graph did not differ from the line graph treatment for any types of questions, but had lower scores for the amount and static questions compared to the scores of the table treatment. It is suggested that the poor performances of the line treatment group and the bar group on the static questions give rise to the need for additional experimental work. This study partially confirms an earlier study which found that tabular reports are better than graphical formats, but does not produce much evidence that there is a strong relationship  between field dependence/independence and the scores on the different types of questions.

        "description":"When education (teaching and/or learning) is considered to be an art, then it seems obvious that the methods of artistic inquiry would be appropriate analysis techniques. Such analysis seems to be rare or non-existent in educational technology. Semiotics, the theory of signs, provides one such set of methodologies for examining text. This presentation uses a variety of semiotic critical methods to explore the products and processes of educational technology as text. Semiotics is often divided into syntactics, semantics and pragmatics, and semiotic criticism can be based on just one or two of these divisions, or it can include all three. Syntactic criticism focuses on the structure of the work. These structures can be assessed simply in terms of the evolution of structural form  (and the possibility of revolutionary change in form), or the forms can be evaluated in relation to the use of the work. Semantic criticism stresses meaning manifest in the work. While semantics are normally applied to textual materials, critics have also used semantics as a formal approach to visual literacy concepts. Pragmatics link antecedents (causes), features of the work, and results. Such inquiry can address unintended or unanticipated effects a work might have on its audience. (CGD)",

        "description":"This paper first reviews the field of educational technology and teaching from two perspectives, that of the technologist and that of the teacher. It is noted that the activities of educational technologists are now defined largely in terms of instructional design and development and are increasingly distanced from the work of ordinary teachers in the public schools; and that the teacher's world is substantially limited by powerful social and administrative pressures to teach in particular ways, which results in very little opportunity to deal with educational technology as something larger than machines and software. The paper then characterizes the current state of the movement to radically restructure education, and suggests how educational technologists might join in and  contribute to that discussion, the central issues of which focus upon democratizing school administration; teacher self-management and professional development; altered classroom roles and emphasis on critical thinking skills; and new modes of research on teaching and teacher preparation. The paper concludes with suggestions, drawn from current research on teaching and educational practice, for new initiatives that educational technologists might take in four areas: (1) the preparation of models for teaching-with-technology; (2) the design of intelligent software; (3) the creation of technologically-based tools to support teachers' professional work and development; and (4) the improvement of research on technology in education.

        "description":"This paper describes the general rationale, hypotheses, methodology, findings and implications of a recent dissertation research project conducted in the Columbus, Ohio, public schools. The computer-based study investigated the simultaneous relationship between achievement in microeconomics and attitude toward economics, level of computer anxiety, and attitude toward learning. Twelfth-grade students (n=155) in regular social science courses at four Columbus senior high schools were randomly assigned to alternative instructional treatments. Each treatment, emphasizing either a problem-oriented strategy or a rule-oriented strategy, consisted of a week-long computer-based unit teaching fundamental economic concepts and principles of supply, demand, and equilibrium. Pre-, post-, and  delayed-post measures were given, and appropriate data analyses completed. Results of these analyses indicate that individuals receiving problem-oriented instruction performed at a higher level on all of the cognitive achievement scales, although this difference was significant only for questions on the lower-order subscale of Posttest I. There is also evidence that a problem-oriented strategy may positively influence attitudes towards economics, as well as the degree of sophistication towards economic issues generally.

        "description":"Student attitudes were investigated in an attempt to determine systematic attitudinal differences among various types of instructional control. Ninety-nine undergraduate students from a basic educational media course volunteered for this study. Six interactive video lessons--covering basic technical aspects of 35 millimeter photography--were designed; they combined visuals and sound from the videodisc and text from the computer. The design of these materials allowed for either program or learner control of pacing, as well as program or learner control of sequence, thereby establishing four treatment groups: learner control of pacing and sequence; learner control of pacing/program control of sequence; program control of pacing/learner control of sequence; and program control of  pacing and sequence. The attitudinal instrument--composed of nine Likert-scale items and an open-ended question asking for additional comments about the instructional program--was given to all subjects. In general, attitudes toward learner control revealed in this study support earlier research and demonstrate positive effects for both types of learner control and no change as compared to program control. Student attitudes toward the use of interactive video systems were consistently high across all groups, with students giving high ratings to the use of videodisc and generally to the text from the computer. This support was reflected both in the Likert items and the open-ended question. However, there were no statistical differences between the different types of instructional control  for the interactive video system. (19 references) (CGD)",

A study on text density was designed to identify alternative methods for displaying computer text; it focused on the level of richness or detail presented in text displays, i.e., density level. A second study on text density was designed to extend the first study in several ways, e.g., use of larger samples; use of both immediate and delayed achievement posttests; and an extended examination of learner control. The first study was designed to determine how individual density levels were  judged relative to one another by examining student preference for two different screen designs, while the primary interest in the second study was to determine replicability of the results of the first one when only the first screen of each density level was presented. In general, findings revealed that low-density format is a viable alternative to the standard text format used in printed materials; subjects indicated a strong preference for learning from high-density screens as opposed to low-density screens; and future research on CBI screen designs should investigate the use of text density and varying screen density in different content areas, and for tasks with different processing demands.

        "description":"Manipulation of flowcharting was crossed with in-class computer access to examine flowcharting effects in the traditional lecture/laboratory setting and in a classroom setting where online time was replaced with manual simulation. Seventy-two high school students (24 male and 48 female) enrolled in a computer literacy course served as subjects. None had received any programming instruction. Four treatment groups were arranged by crossing the computer access variable (unlimited vs. limited) with flowcharting (required vs. not required), and five instructional units dealing with introductory concepts in the BASIC programming language were presented in eighteen 50-minute class periods. Results showed that group means on four of five posttest measures were directionally higher for  the limited-access group than for the unlimited-access group; females performed better under limited access, while males showed the opposite pattern; and low-ability students performed better with unlimited access, while middle- and high-ability students performed conversely. In addition, students performed better when not required to submit flowcharts, and flowcharting appeared to be regarded by many students as an entirely separate task rather than as a programming aid. Gender was not significantly related to either achievement or attitude. Three important considerations for the teaching of programming are suggested by these results: (1) unlimited computer access may be less important than is generally assumed; (2) more time should be given to instruction in flowcharting than is  typically done; and (3) males and females appear to have the same potential and instructional needs for learning programming.

        "description":"A critical process in developing lessons for computer-based instruction (CBI) is to determine the manner in which information will be displayed on the screen, taking care not to ignore the computer's special display capabilities. The underlying assumption of this study was that reducing the density of text presentation would be effective for improving readability and learning under CBI. Subjects were 221 preservice teachers, who were randomly assigned to seven treatment groups according to a 2 (presentation mode: CBI or print) x 3 (density condition: high, low, or learner control) factorial design with one outside condition, &quot;full&quot; learner control of density and media selection. A preattitude survey, pretest, and reading test were administered during a regular class session.  Major dependent variables consisted of four achievement measures (knowledge, calculation, and transfer subtests and a delayed posttest), total attitude score, and lesson completion time. Results supported earlier findings with print material by showing low-density text to be as effective as high-density text on every achievement measure. In contrast, fairly effective meta-cognition strategies appear to have been used by both low-achievers and high-achievers in selecting text density. Finally, no meaningful differences between presentation media were found on task outcomes. It may be that comparing media is less important than the selective and systematic matching of instructional strategies to the specific media that must powerfully represent them.

Seemingly, the most powerful intervention is the pairing of each student with a personal tutor. The tutor leaves assignments and writes messages and feedback over an electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS) accessed by modem. This study, which focused on the BBS tutoring component, involved 120 fifth- and sixth-grade ACOT students and their parents, teachers, and tutors, who typically had little or no computer experience. Volunteer tutors were solicited from the Master of Arts in Teaching Program at Memphis State University, and the  host system was a 512 Macintosh with a 20 megabyte hard drive disk and an Apple Personal Modem. The research orientation included formative evaluation of instructional materials and methods to determine how they were working and to identify any needed refinements; and summative evaluation to examine end-of-year outcomes on a variety of performance and affective variables. The findings revealed that the performance of ACOT students was superior to that of controls on standardized achievement tests in reading and math, as well as in certain aspects of writing; girls used the BBS more than boys; most students developed considerable proficiency at keyboarding over the school year; and tutors generally regarded their activities as beneficial to them personally and to the tutees. Future studies  will, however, monitor standardized test performance more closely. (12 references) (CGD)",

A pilot test of a semester-long high school chemistry curriculum delivered by TLTG was conducted during the 1987-1988 school year, in part to investigate teacher attitudes and teacher implementation behavior. Twenty-six teachers participated in the interactive videodisc (IVD) study, which also made use of records of 2,297 students and achievement data collected from a sample of the students (N = 338). The major findings revealed that IVD students  generally achieved higher scores than non-IVD students; IVD students indicated a greater degree of intention to enroll in an elective science course than control students; most teachers liked using the curriculum and found it easier to teach than the traditional curricula; all teachers used supplemental materials in conjunction with the curriculum; and all teachers felt that their students had learned more using the TLTG curriculum than they had learned in previous years. Both videotaped classroom observations of the TLTG curriculum and staff visits to all of the school districts using the curriculum were made during the pilot year. A new evaluation plan has been formulated for the field test year of the TLTG evaluation (1988-1989), and data are being collected on the actual on-site  implementation of the TLTG field test curriculum.

One of three surveys was administered to incoming teacher credential candidates to determine their media skills and opinions. Of the 161 students who completed the pre-course questionnaire, 103 (64%) had some experience producing instructional media, and 124 (77%) had used computer software for word processing, entertainment and educational games, spreadsheets, database packages, or programming languages. Final course evaluations indicated that 68% of the 476  students who completed the evaluations strongly agreed or agreed that they liked the course, and 86% said they would use what they had learned in a course of their teaching. A survey of 22 new teachers was conducted at the end of their first year of teaching. They described the media they had used and produced during the past year; the most common application of computers in their classrooms; the most useful media skills they had learned; the media that they most wanted to learn about; and ways in which they felt educational technology would change teaching in the next 5 years. Responses to a survey of the opinions of seven teacher education block leaders indicated that they taught objective writing and lesson planning, and most agreed that they preferred that these topics not be taught  in the media courses. They also expressed their opinions on the ways in which they felt technology would change the teacher's role and responsibilities in the next 5 years. (6 references) (CGD)",

It is also argued that all higher order knowledge--except for a very simple goal switching control mechanism--appears in some degree to be tied to content, and that the importance of cultural (or incidental) knowledge in cognitive behavior  can be viewed in a similar manner, bearing in mind that such knowledge can also be made explicit.

The major questions examined in the three-part study of school superintendents related to the current status of the use of the technology; the attitudes held by superintendents toward this particular application of satellites; the immediate, short-term plans of the schools for using satellites; and the ways in which satellite courses should be administered. The student  survey addressed such issues as characteristics of students enrolling in satellite courses; the reasons students have enrolled in these courses; their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of interactive satellite instruction; and the perceived difficulties and benefits of taking satellite courses. The final study, which surveyed teachers and school administrators, explored the appropriateness of the use of the technology for this purpose; the probable impact on the teaching profession and on the school curriculum; and the adequacy of quality control when satellite courses are delivered. The results of all three studies indicated that satellite technology generally received a positive but cautious endorsement, and that it was felt to be particularly practical in the distance  education situation.

        "author":["Streibel, Michael J."],
        "description":"This paper discusses the implications of Lucy Suchman's conclusion that a theory of situated action--i.e., the actual sense that specific users make out of specific Xeroxing events--is truer to the lived experience of Xerox users than a cognitive account of the user's plans--e.g., the hierarchy of subprocedures for how Xerox machines should be used. It is argued that this distinction poses a challenge for cognitively based instructional design because it leads to two questions: whether instructional plans should be designed into instructional systems in order to control instructional interactions when the users of such systems learn in a situated-action manner and not in a plan-based manner, and whether any instructional or learning theory should be used to guide the actions of  teachers or learners. Suchman's ideas about plans and situated actions, as well as the implications of these ideas for the design and use of instructional systems, are discussed under the following subheadings: plans and instructional systems; the problematic of plans and instructional practice; plans and situated actions; and plans and situated learning. A brief analysis of the work of John Seely Brown, who is a colleague of Suchman at the Xerox Palo Alto (California) Research Center and one of the founders of the field of intelligent tutoring systems, is then presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of Brown's contention that situated learning is a more accurate account of the phenomena of how people actually learn in the presence of intelligent tutoring systems than the  cognitive theory of plans. Appended are 10 graphic representations of various topics discussed in the paper, e.g., the cognitivist paradigm, instructional systems, and aspects of cognition. (27 references) (CGD)",

        "description":"This paper examines the cognitive processes associated with higher-order thinking strategies--i.e., cognitive processes directly associated with the employment of knowledge in the service of problem solving and creativity--in order to more clearly define a prescribed instructional method to improve problem-solving skills. The first section of the paper presents an overview of a learning and cognition model for the purposes of illustrating the relationship between the proposed instructional method and higher-order thinking strategies, and discusses a number of specific basic components of the cognitive system model, e.g., perception, short-term and working memory, and long-term memory. In addition, the following related concepts are explored: (1) cognitive complexity; (2)  criteria; (3) intelligence; (4) conditions in the development of thinking strategies; (5) recall; (6) problem-solving; and (7) creativity. The second part of the paper establishes an interest in complex problem simulations that can help students improve their cognitive complexity in problem solving. As an example of this, it is noted that the Minnesota Adaptive Instructional System (MAIS) offers a system that integrates higher-order thinking strategies and knowledge acquisition. Also described here is the design strategy of complex problem simulations, the components of which include necessary knowledge, simulation, and learning environment. The third section briefly describes some software examples of this instructional method. (30 references) (CGD)",

        "description":"This paper defines the next generation of intelligent computer-assisted instructional systems (ICAI) by depicting the elaborations and extensions offered by educational research and theory perspectives to enhance the ICAI environment. The first section describes conventional ICAI systems, which use expert systems methods and have three modules: a knowledge base, a student model, and a tutor model. The second section discusses the ICAI system of the future--a system that elaborates and extends the three basic modules of the conventional ICAI system--and explains how the future system will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) tools and methods with instructional variables and conditions empirically tested and shown to improve learning. It is concluded that the next generation  ICAI will use a comprehensive meta-learning model which would take individual differences into account in the assessment and diagnosis processes, and make reference to both the learner's acquisition (i.e., storage) and retrieval of knowledge; it will select the strategies of instruction from a rich base of instructional variables according to learning objectives and the structure of the information to be learned; and it will use the concepts of artificial intelligence in the form of heuristics that have the capacity to learn and to adjust according to given situations. Some examples of major advantages that may result from the use of the next generation ICAI system conclude the paper. (18 references) (CGD)",

Each of the following program objectives is discussed: (1) to encourage 200 people to attend the seminar; (2) to establish uniform statistics to meet future planning and service needs and program development; (3) to increase literacy activities in the next fiscal year; (4) to provide follow-up meetings in each region of the state; (5) to establish local literacy coalitions; (6) to  increase the number of literacy students receiving library cards; and (7) to maintain local involvement once initial enthusiasm has subsided. A memo offering the LITMAS (Literacy Information Management System) software to organizations willing to participate as test sites is appended. (MES)",

Issues addressed included: (1) the percentage of questions assistants cannot answer themselves that are referred to professionals; (2) the percentage of questions more appropriately answered on another floor or department that are referred to that floor or department; (3) the percentage of questions requiring the patron to go to an outside collection that are referred to that collection; (4) the percentage of requests for documents not possessed by the library that are referred to interlibrary loan; and (5) the percentage of appropriate referrals by paraprofessional assistants compared  with referrals by student assistants. The study population included 38 assistants at five reference desks. Eleven proxies asked the assistants a total of 125 reference questions over a 3-week period. These questions were designed to study the accuracy, negotiation, and referral aspects of reference service. Results indicated that the assistants are aware of their limits and the limits of the collections, as well as other collections in the library and on campus. Referral performance was impressive except for the lack of referral to interlibrary loan. Suggestions for further research are included.

The report begins with an illustrated overview of retrieval features and subject searching in current second-generation OPACs, which is followed by a discussion of the problems and shortcomings of conventional OPACs and online information retrieval systems, especially with regard to subject access and retrieval methods. A summary discussion of perspectives, models, and design contributions from the information retrieval research and experimentation community is then presented, and an illustrated review  and analysis of intelligent interfaces and retrieval methods is provided. The discussion facilitates a refined grouping of the issues into four major areas: (1) ease of use, orientation, and presentation factors; (2) vocabulary control and correlation factors; (3) more effective system-guided or automatic query formulation and retrieval techniques; and (4) meaningful engagement of the searcher in relevance assessments, query modification/expansion, and provision of smart navigational, exploration facilities. A summary of recommended design principles and achievements in intelligent interface and retrieval system design concludes the report. A checklist of features of second-generation OPACs and a list of OPAC and retrieval systems and software investigated for the study are appended. (51  references) (MES)",

The second section summarizes the results of a 1986 survey of online providers in the schools which examined four basic questions: (1) who is searching in the schools; (2) what the policies are regarding online in the schools; (3) systems, databases, hardware, and software used in the schools; and (4) the demographics of online search providers. The third section summarizes the findings of the survey, and an annotated bibliography of materials on the topic published in the 1980's is presented in the  fourth section. A total of 41 items are grouped in the following categories: Introductions to the Topic; Recent Texts and Instructional Guides; Recent Articles about Online Searching in the Schools; Accounts of Practice by School Media Specialists; and Management of Online Information Services. Journals that publish articles on online searching in the schools and bibliographies covering the topic are also listed in this section. Lists of selected document delivery services and vendor contacts for school media specialists are appended.

        "description":"The educational reform movement of the 1980s has sparked a renewed emphasis on the quality of teaching and learning, not only in community colleges, but at every level of education. Most teachers embark upon their careers knowing very little about teaching and learning and, unfortunately, remain naive observers of their profession. Classroom research provides an opportunity for teachers to sensitively and knowledgeably observe their students' learning and the day-to-day effects of their teaching. Drawing upon stimulus-response and cognitive psychological theories of learning, classroom research calls upon college teachers to obtain feedback from their students throughout the semester and to use the results to form or shape instruction as it progresses. Classroom research  increases the productive interactions between teaching and learning by investigating what teachers do to cause learning. The tools of classroom research are necessarily different from the statistical methods of traditional educational research. One tool, called \"Minute Papers,\" asks students to state the most important thing they learned during a class session and identify the questions that remain uppermost in their minds. Classroom research methods are designed to integrate research on the effectiveness of instruction into everyday teaching on an ongoing, self-renewing basis. The teaching orientation and comprehensive curricula of the community college make it the ideal arena for classroom research. (JMC)",

        "description":"Almost from its inception, Sheffield City Polytechnic has operated a system whereby each academic department allocates to every student a &quot;personal tutor,&quot; who provides academic, professional, and personal assistance throughout the student's course of study. In 1988-89, in response to fiscal constraints, a number of departments made no formal allocation of personal tutors, relying instead on academic tutors to fulfill their role. In an effort to prepare academic tutors to meet these expectations, the college initiated a number of projects, including an in-house course on student support and tutoring; seminars/workshops bringing together academic and student support practitioners; and the preparation of an information packet for academic staff. In addition, the college undertook a  study of student support services, focusing on the academic tutors with responsibility for students' first year of study. Interviews with personnel in every department revealed that sometimes the least experienced faculty had responsibility for providing student support. With case loads of up to 200 students, many of the tutors felt overburdened, especially facing students with major personal problems, such as family violence, pregnancy, and ill-health. Many tutors felt inadequately prepared or unwilling to deal with these problems. Asked about possible staff development, the staff requested briefing and support. Before selecting an approach to staff development, colleges should determine which model of student services best reflects their own programs. Predominant models include the  pastoral care or &quot;in loco parentis&quot; model; the professional student services model; the curriculum model which bases student support within academic departments; and the personnel management model, in which the institution assumes responsibility for aspects of employee (i.e., student) welfare and training.

        "description":"In 1989, a study was conducted of the transfer rates achieved by the University of Minnesota's General College (GC) students. In order to collect a body of comparative statistics, a literature review was conducted on the accuracy of transfer rate calculations, national data on transfer rates, variables believed to affect transfer, and indicators used to evaluate the transfer mission of two-year colleges. The literature revealed that: (1) the unreliability of transfer data, due to differences in institutional characteristics and counting procedures, makes it impossible to obtain an aggregated national norm; (2) when total institutional enrollment is used as the potential transfer pool, transfer rates are usually estimated to be between 5% and 15%; however, when potential transfer  pools are restricted to full-time freshmen, estimated transfer rates range from 20% to 40%; and (3) student preparation, ability, motivation, and intent to acquire a baccalaureate are believed to have strong and direct effects on transfer. The study of GC transfer rates focused on the personal characteristics, academic performance, retention, and transfer patterns of 1,042 freshman who entered GC in summer or fall 1986. Of the students, 22.2% transferred to another unit within the University by winter 1989. Asian-Americans had the highest transfer rates (36%), followed by Hispanics (26%), Whites (22%), Blacks (15%), and American Indians (12%). Of 1,042 students, 3.3% never completed their first quarter, 6.9% dropped out after their first quarter, 17.8% never enrolled again after the first  academic year, and 31.4% were still enrolled at GC in fall 1988. Cumulative grade point average after two quarters was closely related to eventual transfer. A 62-item bibliography is attached. (JMC)",

The study report compares the perceptions of these three groups, identifies areas of agreement and conflict, and concludes that over 90% of the respondents agreed that 28 of the 48 functions should be part of the departmental chairpersons' responsibilities. In the third paper, &quot;Recommendations and Leadership Implications,&quot; a plan to develop and implement a job description for DTCC's departmental chairpersons is presented.

The Future Shop lab had three major components: (1) career assessment and exploration, including a career resources library, career interest assessments, a mentor program, a job fair, and employee education; (2) job transition and grooming, including interview coaching, seminars in resume writing and 4-year college transfer, and a video library; and (3) placement and transition support, including a computerized job referral system, college-affiliated job listings, job lead resources,  and transfer articulation resources. All three model components were implemented at CCCCD, and one or more of the components were also piloted at 10 other Texas community colleges. Over 15,000 community college students utilized Future Shop services at one or more of the 11 participating colleges. Several means of evaluation were employed, including user feedback, comments from the participating institutions, advisory committee evaluations, and assessment by an external consultant. Overall, the evaluations were supportive of the Future Shop concept and the program. This manual provides an overview of the model; descriptions of the CCCCD program, including information on marketing, intake processes, and number of participants; descriptions of the pilot projects at the other colleges;  summaries of project evaluations; a 135-item bibliography of materials in the career resources library; marketing resources; and detailed evaluation results.

Students with no record of completing these prerequisites cannot enroll unless they have been assessed by a counselor, have had their prerequisites verified in alternate ways, and have been granted override status for enrollment. In fall 1988, 9,952 overrides were granted based on the completion of equivalent coursework, instructor evaluations, life experience, previous degrees, and other reasons. A study was conducted to compare the academic success of students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites with that of students who had enrolled on override status. Study findings included the following: (1) 65% of the  students who had completed both course and basic skills requirements (N=34,831) received a grade of A, B, C, or Credit, compared to 59% of those who enrolled on override status; (2) 46% of the counselors successfully placed more than 60% of their students, compared with 32% of the counselors in spring 1988; (3) 69% of the students who were granted overrides on the basis of life experience or previous degrees received a C or higher in their coursework, as did 63% of those who documented completion of previous coursework; and (4) the greatest proportion of A and B grades were achieved by students with an override based on life experience and students with previous degrees. Study findings supported the conclusion that counselors who strictly enforce prerequisites, use a careful evaluation of  relevant life experience, and rely on documented evidence of previous coursework can place students effectively.

From the outset, colleges were encouraged to limit their investigation to barriers over which the college had control. By the end of the first six months, it was clear that all of the colleges, regardless of size, location, and mandate, shared common concerns about improving conditions for part-time learners. The most commonly identified issues included the following: (1) the need for colleges to explore alternative times and locations for the delivery of programs; (2) the need to market part-time opportunities within the  community; (3) the need to provide part-time students with the same services (e.g., counseling, bookstore, cafeteria, and property maintenance) as full-time students; and (4) the need to develop systems for the assessment of prior learning by offering challenge tests, making credits from other postsecondary institutions transferable, and giving credit for experience. Among the specific barriers to enrollment identified by the colleges, 36% were categorized as operational. Barriers included limited course selections, scheduling problems, unavailability of support services, lack of information and communication, poor marketing and advertising, and inadequate counseling, orientation, and remedial services. Another 15.6% of the barriers related to institutional policy, 11% to attitudes, 9.46%  to social conditions, and 7.42% to student finances. The project report includes brief descriptions of the methods and findings of the self-assessments of the 31 colleges and an article, &quot;Prior Learning Assessment in Quebec Colleges,&quot; by Robert Isabelle and Francine Landry.

The eight sections of the developmental course focus on: (1) literal and simultaneous equations, exponents, scientific notation, graphs, and geometry; (2) right triangle trigonometry; (3) equilibrium and friction; (4) torque and rotational equilibrium; (5) uniformly accelerated motion, gravity, and free-falling bodies; (6) force and acceleration; (7) energy and momentum; and (8) rotational motion. The text and accompanying software used in the course cover the same topics as standard college physics books,  but at an introductory level. Data on the achievement of former developmental studies (DS) students in subsequent college-level physics courses were gathered for summer 1986 through fall 1988. These data revealed that 62.8% of the 188 former DS students who enrolled in Physics 201, &quot;Mechanics,&quot; earned a passing grade, compared to 58.3% of the 1,790 non-DS students. In all three trigonometry-based physics courses, former DS students had higher pass rates than non-DS students, but more non-DS students earned a grade of C or better. Of the nine former DS students who enrolled in Physics 221, the calculus-based physics course, four passed. Syllabi and information on the course textbooks are provided for all the developmental and college-level physics courses. (JMC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted in 1989 to determine the impact of the Factors Affecting Minority Enrollment (FAME) program on the recruitment and retention of black students at Florida Community College at Jacksonville (FCCJ). The FAME program offers minority and low-income high school students a 10-week, precollege orientation focusing on FCCJ's degree and certificate programs; a 7-credit summer program including a course on &quot;Student Success,&quot;&quot;English Composition I&quot;, and &quot;Dynamics of Behavior&quot; or an equivalent social science course; and $1,000 incentive grants for two students. The program evaluation sought to determine FAME completion rates, subsequent rates of enrollment at FCCJ, withdrawal patterns among college programs, and degree completion rates. The subjects of the study were  1,048 black students from 12 randomly selected Jacksonville area public high schools who had participated in the FAME program between 1985 and 1989. Major findings included the following: (1) 353 of the participants attended five or more FAME sessions, and 270 eventually enrolled at FCCJ; (2) 75% of the FAME participants were female; (3) during 1986, 1987, and 1989, there was a decline in the percentage of participants who completed the FAME program; (4) the average length of time taken to enroll at FCCJ after participating in the FAME program was one year, although 24% of the students enrolled three to six months later and 8% enrolled at FCCJ after three or more years; (5) 52% of the FAME students attending FCCJ enrolled on a part-time basis; and (6) by 1989, 11% of the FAME/FCCJ  students had received associate degrees.

        "description":"An overview is provided of trends and issues in the financial support of Texas's community colleges. Part I provides introductory comments on the functions, enrollments, and costs of the state's public community college system. Part II reviews nationwide trends in the state and local support of two-year colleges, effects of declining revenues, models of financial support, and efforts to stabilize funding. Part III offers a historical overview of the funding process in Texas and explains the contact hour system used to support all instructional costs other than facilities construction, maintenance, and operation. Under the contact hour system of funding, appropriations are based on a median cost figure for each program applied to the contact hours produced for that program. The  structure enables each community college to receive a line item appropriation each biennium based on contact hours produced by the college during the previous funding period. After highlighting the benefits of this funding structure, the paper details state appropriations for 1988-89 and discusses other sources of college revenue. Part IV identifies funding issues for the 1990's and beyond, including the need to diversify the state's economy; the the need for colleges to solicit corporate and private financial support; the effects of state legislation mandating skills assessment and remediation for entering college students; and the impact of population dynamics. After part V discusses the implications of the state's continuation as the primary funding source for the community college  system, part VI draws conclusions and offers recommendations. (ALB)",

        "description":"In 1988, a study was conducted to determine whether and to what extent the principles of opportunity, accessibility, adaptability, and comprehensiveness upon which Canada's community colleges were established have survived into the 1980's. The theoretical model underpinning the study was based on a three-dimensional matrix in which theories of adaptation and power formed two dimensions, and several developmental models specific to the community college as an organization comprised the third. The methodology involved an intensive study of 14 community colleges with respect to their educational programs, students, teaching and support staff, administration, curricula and instruction, delivery of instruction, accessibility, governance, advisory bodies, relations with government,  personnel relations, finances, and relations with the community. The results of surveys of key constituent groups at these colleges, including presidents, board members, administrators, faculty, support staff, and students, revealed that much of the idealism and innovation which guided the colleges in the 1960's is still to be found in the 1980's. However, due to an increase in government regulation and a reduction in financial support, Canadian colleges had to invent new ways of dealing with external forces during the last decade. In the process, they became more entrepreneurial, less community-oriented, and more tightly managed. (Author/ALB)",

First, several hypotheses accounting for the rise of the community college in America are summarized, including those pointing to a conspiracy of the elite, a populist alliance, and a clique of professional educators. A profile is then provided of community colleges, their students, and the forces forming the unique character of two-year colleges. The next section looks at occupational studies in the community college curriculum, focusing on two-year college students' job-related educational goals, trends in enrollments and degree awards, charges of ethnic bias in tracking students into occupational programs, high  dropout rates, vocational education programs as a stepping stone to the baccalaureate, and the organization of career education as a separate curricular track. The transfer function is discussed in the next section in terms of the lack of reliable data on transfer rates, reasons for the low rates, factors influencing student progress toward the baccalaureate, aids to transfer, and statewide efforts to promote articulation. In the next section, the contributions of the community colleges are reviewed. The final sections look at the rate of return on students' investment in a community college education, college contributions to individual mobility, and the special effects of community colleges on minorities.

        "description":"Sacramento City College (SCC) established its Re-Entry Services program to provide information, referral and support services to students returning to the academic environment after an absence. Since the inception of the program in 1977, the college community has changed considerably. Among these changes are an aging student population, increased enrollment by women and part-time students, the proliferation of nontraditional job training opportunities, and an increased emphasis on sex equity on campus. Prepared in response to these changes, this report provides a comprehensive plan for SCC's Re-Entry Services. The plan's major components address the need to: (1) provide academic, vocational, and personal advising and refer students to appropriate ancillary services and  information resources; (2) offer support services for the retention of re-entry students, including workshops, financial aid, and role models; (3) provide resources for career exploration which emphasize freedom of career choice without regard to traditional sex or ethnic stereotyping; (4) maximize community outreach for the recruitment of potential students; and (5) ensure that the program is staffed and managed well. For each component, specific objectives are stated, along with planned activities and methods of evaluating the achievement of the objectives. The plan includes background information on the program, the need for re-entry services, enrollment trends, cost information, and an outline of the expansion of services. In addition, newly developed job descriptions, case histories  of successful program participants, and information concerning the use of Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act single parent/homemaker and sex bias funds are provided. (ALB)",

It was hypothesized that since dreams recalled from childhood are relatively high in archetypal content, there should be differences between the perceptions of childhood dreams by adult intuitives and sensate subjects, but no differences between introvert and extravert subjects. Participants were 67 volunteer final-year early childhood teacher-training students, each of whom completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator as a personality measure, and a Childhood Dream Questionnaire (CDQ). All subjects but one were female. Scores on the  Intuition-Sensation and Introversion-Extraversion dimensions were correlated with CDQ item scores. In accord with the hypotheses, significant correlations were found with respect to Intuition-Sensation scores, and none for the Introversion-Extaversion dimension. (RH)",

The change involved most children who began attending the school in 1985 and 1986 (about 180 children aged 5, 6, and 7 years), their parents, 8 teachers, and the school administration team. The decision to change the style of curriculum was related to a concern that too many young children were kept at a disadvantage by curriculum practices in which all children were presented with the same learning experiences at the same time. This report looks at teachers' efforts to create and implement a curriculum which would cater to developmental differences among learners. This curriculum was based on mixed-age classes and hands on activity. Issues and events that influenced  teacher actions are discussed. Topics of the report include: (1) preparation for change in the second semester of 1985; (2) the process of getting started; (3) consolidation; (4) facilitation of the learning process; and (5) tentative plans for future changes.

In addition, jobs that limit occupational self-direction decrease men's intellectual flexibility and promote a conformist orientation to self and society. Environmentally complex work conditions increase adult intellectual flexibility. Part of the intellectual decrement reported in the elderly may result from the reduced complexity of their work environments. The experience of self-direction may affect intellectual flexibility differently at different stages of one's educational and occupational career.

        "description":"This study examined whether evidence for understanding the distinction between natural and man-made aspects of the world can be found in young children. Children 3, 5, and 7 years of age were asked to make judgments about the origins of 12 objects and people's ability to change the objects. The objects were evenly divided into naturally occurring objects such as clouds and mountains, and man-made objects such as helicopters and spoons. Results suggested that the youngest children were unable to answer the origins questions correctly, while members of both older groups were able to do so. More children in all three age groups correctly indicated the origins of man-made objects more frequently than of naturally occurring ones. When asked whether people could change the objects  pictured in the photographs, the youngest answered that they could not, while the older children answered that they could. Crafted objects were seen as more amenable to change than natural ones. For positive responses to the change question, age differences were found in kinds of suggested alterations consistent with earlier observations about children's conceptual development from perceptual to functional changes. Children in all age groups correctly categorized unfamiliar objects despite their inability to identify them correctly. It is concluded that by the age of 7 years, children seem able to differentiate between natural and man-made objects. (RH)",

        "description":"Effects of a small but intensive family support program provided to impoverished inner-city parents who had had a healthy firstborn child during the period of 1968-1970, were examined. Services were: (1) based on a clinical, family-support model; (2) individually tailored to each family; (3) provided by a team of pediatricians, social workers, psychologists, and day care workers; and (4) provided from the child's birth to 30 months postpartum. Approximately 10 years after the program ended, outcomes for mothers were examined in the areas of family size, socioeconomic status, and parenting style. When intervention and control group participants were compared, positive long-term effects of intervention were found in all three areas. The families of intervention mothers were smaller  than those of control mothers. Years after the intervention had ended, intervention mothers were overwhelmingly likely to be part of a self-supporting family, either because of their own commitment to education and job training, or because they had married someone who could support them. Intervention mothers had good relationships with their children and were able to parent their children effectively. It is concluded that the results provide evidence that early, clinically based family support intervention can have long-lasting effects for care receivers. (RH)",

Blocked into low and high verbal skill groups, participants in study 1 were 84 middle-class third- and fifth-grade elementary school students. Subjects performed a multi-trial verbal task in which they were required to indicate their confidence in the correctness of their tentative solution and subsequently were given the opportunity to seek help before providing a final solution on each trial. The second experiment involved 39 subjects and differed from the first in that subjects were provided with a common motivation for seeking help. Findings indicated that subjects' confidence in the correctness of their  solution influenced both the frequency and type of help sought. High task-related skill was associated with the discriminating use of help-seeking as an achievement strategy, especially among boys. Both the frequency and type of help sought varied with self-assessments for older children, and varied more than was the case among younger children. Findings are discussed in terms of grade and sex differences in the use of internally based cues for performance evaluation. The importance of accounting for the interplay of children's age and task-specific skill with achievement-related goals is stressed. (RH)",

Study 3 explored children's responses to different forms of the expression of anger. Findings indicated that: (1) children responded to parents' anger as a stressor; (2) a sensitization hypothesis may describe the ways in which children's coping patterns were altered by marital discord; (3) subjects were characterized by discrete patterns of response  to anger for many social, emotional, and physiological response dimensions; (4) response organization was stable over time; (5) all forms of angry interactions were perceived as negative events and elicited negative emotions; (6) unresolved anger was perceived as a far more negative event than resolved anger and induced far greater feelings of anger and distress in children; and (7) boys consistently reported more angry responses than girls and girls tended to report more feelings of distress.

        "description":"In a study of children's moral development, four toddlers and their mothers were observed at home approximately every three weeks when toddlers were 13-23 months of age. Six behavioral signs of children's awareness of standards were coded: (1) proud looks, achievement smiles, statements of accomplishment; (2) awareness of, interest in, and exclamations about flawed objects and discrepant events; (3) awareness of a violation; (4) awareness that something was potentially harmful; (5) use of moral vocabulary, use of labels such as &quot;good,&quot;&quot;bad,&quot; or &quot;yucky,&quot; and questioning or reciting of a rule; and (6) saying &quot;Uh-oh&quot; in response to accidents or with no evident reference. Mothers' remarks related to achievement, discrepancy, transgression, and empathy were coded. All four children  showed peaks in signs between 17 and 18 months, and first displayed empathy between 16 and 19 months. Patterns of maternal communications followed the changes in children's behaviors. A class of behavior that was almost completely free of maternal input was interest in flawed objects and discrepant events. After 17 months, children were able to infer wrongdoing and another person's intentions. A major increase in use of internal state words occurred around the time of the peak in awareness of standards. Data suggest that early signs of moral concern may depend more on maturational than on socialization processes. About 90 references are cited. (RH)",

Participants included 59 healthy, full-term and sick, preterm infants. The sick, preterm infants included infants who developed respiratory or neurological complications during the perinatal period. Discussion addresses relationships between: (1) neonatal measures and behavioral observations of infant temperament; (2) medical high-risk variables and behavioral observations of infant temperament; (3) behavioral observations and concurrent parental reports; and (4) the stability of behavioral observations during infants' third through seventh months. The studies indicated that neonatal  characteristics, including Brazelton behavioral scores, cry acoustic characteristics, and medical status affect infants' temperament. Both individual and group differences were observed. There was some stability in behavioral observations between 3 and 7 months of age. Magnitudes of correlations were small except for soothability. Findings suggest that a great deal of change occurs in infant temperament during the first year of life. Moderate agreement was found between parents' reports and behavioral observations; this attested to the concurrent validity of the measures. (RH)",

The four issues involve: (1) the definition of morality; (2) individual or cultural moral variation; (3) moral ontogeny; and (4) moral epistemology. The first section of the paper describes each issue. The second section is based on the argument that the four issues can be combined in six paired combinations, four of which often result in confusions or conflations in the theoretical and empirical research literature. Each of the four problematic combinations is discussed. It is suggested that while the content of moral-developmental controversies can vary widely, the sources of the controversies are often bounded by one or more of the four issues under consideration. Examples are offered of  ways in which moral theory and research have confused evidence that pertains to two or more of the issues. While these issues are analytically distinct, they often can and should be brought together in moral theory and research. Approximately 75 references are cited. (RH)",

The long-term goal of the partnership between Fordham's Graduate Schools of Education and Social Science and New York City School District No. 4, a school district heavily populated by minorities, was to allocate resources of the university to help public school staff in their efforts to keep students in school. Three questions are addressed: (1) How much impact did SSPP have on the attendance rate of at-risk children? (2) What effects did it have on their academic achievement? (3) What types of practices and strategies were most effective with the children? Answers were based on data concerning  attendance rates, reading and math performance, self-esteem, adequacy of child care, levels of social service, parent participation, and an emerging practice profile of the project. The practice profile indicated ideal, acceptable, and unacceptable variation on project components of assessment, record-keeping, play therapy, tutoring, program coordination, and family problem-solving. It is concluded that the preventive strategies and practices of SSPP described in this paper can benefit others taking similar action to positively change urban schools. (RH)",

The cookies were two sizes, halves and wholes, so even though there were trials with an odd number of cookies, it was possible to divide the cookies evenly. When children's division strategies and accuracy in dividing the cookies were examined, data indicated that subjects frequently used correspondence strategies to divide the cookies, but they did not do so uniformly across all trial types. Both 4- and 5-year-olds consistently used correspondence strategies on small numerosity trials, but only 5-year-olds consistently used these strategies on large numerosity, even number trials. Children of both ages  had difficulty on the large numerosity, odd number trials.

During a home visit before hospitalization, the child's adjustment, cognition, temperament, and family characteristics were assessed. Tonsillectomies were followed by an overnight stay at the hospital, and behavioral ratings were made during that period. One to two weeks after the child returned home, the mother again completed measures of the child's adjustment. Findings indicated that adjustment prior to hospitalization was the strongest predictor of post-surgical adjustment. However, cognitive, temperamental, and family factors were also significant predictors. Children's conceptualizations of illness and medical procedures were strongly  related to general cognitive development, and more sophisticated illness conceptualizations were associated with better adjustment after surgery. Children who displayed the most positive reactions to hospitalization were temperamentally more rhythmical, i.e., had predictable, regular behavior, and tended to be more approaching to new experiences. They were also more adaptable, more positive in mood, more distractible, and had lower thresholds of responsiveness. Measures of family characteristics were less strongly associated with children's reactions to hospitalization. However, maternal anxiety, overprotection, and overindulgence were predictive of poorer adjustment. (Author)",

Findings on data from the two conditions in which mothers participated indicated that differences in mothers' questioning style could be interpreted in terms of the  type of play sparked by the play contexts. In the model kitchen, mothers encouraged children to take the initiative; when children did so, mothers were responsive and supportive participants, taking on roles reciprocal to those taken by the children, and making requests that allowed children to enact their roles more completely. With the assorted toys, children were frequently quite dependent on mothers; mothers responded to dependence by asking questions that directed children's activities and led them to deal successfully with demands posed by the shape box and other toys.

A total of 101 Icelandic school children were assessed on a variety of variables at ages 7, 9, 12, and 15. Only two variables significantly entered into the regression equation predicting academic grades. Friendship reasoning at 9 years and Raven IQ at 7 years accounted for nearly 40% of the variance in grades at 15 years. Three variables significantly predicted teacher ratings of 15-year-olds' social behavior. Friendship stage at 9 years, SES at 7 years, and perspective-taking at 9 years accounted for almost 25% of the variance in social behavior at 15 years. It was concluded that teacher ratings of disparate  domains such as academic performance and social skills are neither non-overlapping nor isomorphic phenomena. (RH)",

        "description":"This study investigated how preadolescents and adolescents solve problems involving three temporal dimensions. Specifically examined was the question of whether speed and space information would influence the time judgments of 90 subjects 9, 12, and 15 years of age who solved 16 word problems describing the displacements of two cars. The problems included either relative orders of succession or included one order of succession and the relative duration of the events. Each problem was presented twice: once with speed information and once wih space information. Participants deduced either the relative duration, or the relative beginning or ending times of the events. Duration judgments and order of succession judgments were compared. Findings indicated that older children made more  correct judgments than younger children. As predicted, certain problems were facilitated when presented with speed information and were more difficult when presented with space information. The effect was reversed for the other problems. Participants had more difficulty reconstructing the beginning time of an event than deducing the ending time. Results support the notion that specific relations exist between the concepts of time, speed, and space. Time judgments may be hindered if these relations conflict. (RH)",

        "description":"In an investigation of the relationship between sharing and children's ability to estimate time under conditions either promoting sharing or not encouraging sharing, 67 children between 65 and 140 months of age first completed a time estimation task and then engaged in a sharing task with a same-age, same-sex peer. The children were given incentives either to share or not to share. As expected, the older children were more accurate in estimating time and also shared more. More sharing occurred when there were incentives to share. Further, controlling for time estimation ability decreased the relationship between age and sharing to nonsignificance in the condition that created an incentive for sharing, but did not decrease this relationship in the condition that did not create an  incentive for sharing. It is concluded that specific cognitive abilities are prerequisite for specific prosocial behaviors, but whether or not children will use these abilities is dependent upon motivational conditions.

Concluding discussion stresses the importance of extensive observational research for investigations of the role of operating principles and environmental input in the process of early lexical development.

        "description":"Because little is presently known about changes in children's knowledge of the logical principles of arithmetic and, more specifically, about how children's developing knowledge is reflected in the use of solution procedures, two types of three-term arithmetic problems were presented for solution to 6-, 7-, 9-, 11-, and 20-year-olds. Problems were to be solved mentally. One type could be solved only by calculating sums and differences. The other type could also be solved without computation by using a procedural shortcut based on the logical principle of inversion, i.e., a + b - b must be equal to a. Analyses of latencies and verbal reports revealed that: (1) some children as young as 6 years of age used inversion-based shortcuts spontaneously; (2) there were marked individual  differences among elementary school children in the use of inversion-based shortcuts; (3) the use of procedural shortcuts based on knowledge of logical principles increased markedly between 9 and 20 years but changed little from 6 to 9 years; and (4) some 6-year-olds used a functional shortcut, the negation procedure, that may be a precursor to inversion-based procedures. It is concluded that the results indicate that early improvements in arithmetic may reflect changes in computational skill rather than in knowledge and use of the logical principles that characterize the domain of arithmetic.

Subjects were 24 children, 12 males and 12 females, of 23 to 27 months, all raised in English-speaking homes. Their mean productive vocabulary was 240 words. A total of 17 had produced utterances of three words or longer; 7 were in the two-word stage of language development. Each child viewed simultaneously presented video events. Between the video monitors, an auditory speaker played a message that matched only one of the video events, or scenes. It was expected that if the utterance was correctly understood, the child would look preferentially at the scene that was consistent with the utterance.  If the utterance was not understood, it was expected that the child would look randomly at either scene. For each of the subjects, a pattern of teaching and testing was repeated for four nonsense verbs. Half of the children heard each verb presented in the transitive audio, and the others heard each verb presented in the intransitive audio. Findings provide strong support for the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis proposed by Landau and Gleitman (1985). (RH)",

Discussion first focuses on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II of 1976-80, and then turns to the National Food Consumption Survey of 1985 and studies of special subpopulations and of hospitalized children. Consequences of adverse nutritional status are discussed in terms of growth, health, malnutrition and infection, cognitive development, and obesity. Particular attention is given to iron deficiency. Subsequent discussion points out that nutritional status is clearly related to income. Poor children were observed to have poorer dietary intakes not in  terms of the relative quality of their diets, but in terms of quantity. Other observations from five surveys revealed inadequate calcium, zinc, and vitamin A and C intakes among poor people in general and blacks in particular, and inadequate iron intakes for all income groups, particularly among blacks. Although the studies reviewed did not directly address program effects, articles that described improved nutrition status associated with participation in food programs were found. Approximately 150 references are cited. (RH)",

Aspects of day care at issue were professionalism and the relationships between the family day care provider, her family, and her clients' families.

The second section presents material which illustrates the normal developmental aspects of graphic growth for each of the three artists. The third section illustrates aspects of the apprenticeship process for each of the three, and the fourth section presents those aspects of the record which suggest the presence of significant creative potential. In all three cases juvenalia was defined as material completed up to  the age of 20 years. Findings indicated that, when young, all three artists experienced difficulties in mastering spatial organization, proportion, and line control. All copied from popular sources, such as comic strips and calendars. All three had a repertoire of stereotyped images which they used for their own private purposes, like other normal children. Comparison with normal children reveals that the three are distinguished by accelerated acquisition of the graphic stages. In general, thematic preferences evident in the artists' juvenile work were evident in their mature works. (RH)",

A total of 120 students from two elementary schools completed the Early Adolescent School Role Strain Inventory during pretransition in the elementary school fifth grade, during early transition at the beginning of the middle school sixth grade, and later in the sixth grade. The inventory assessed the number and magnitude of school-related strains related to school demands, teacher relations, peer interaction, and parent control. It was hypothesized that because of differences in the characteristics of students' families, teacher expectations, and school size and location, students from one of the elementary schools would experience an easier transition  to middle school in terms of changes in strain. It was also hypothesized that boys would demonstrate a more favorable strain change profile than would girls. Results of repeated measures MANOVAs provided strong support for both hypotheses. Findings suggest that elementary school preparation and gender can significantly affect the quality of the transition to middle school. The study also suggests that the role strain approach is a potentially valuable tool for assessing stress during the transition. Seven figures are included. (RH)",

Infants were presented 70 pictures in a session of approximately 2 minutes. Pictures appeared randomly in 1 of 6 locations.

This picture was always  preceded by a picture on the opposite side and a 1,000 ms no-stimulus interval. The infant's right eye was videotaped using standard infrared corneal reflection techniques. Findings indicated that predictability of location positively affected response time, while predictability of time of appearance did not. However, evidence was found to substantiate the claim that predictability of time of appearance can affect performance.

        "description":"This paper contributes to the debate on whether day care is harmful or beneficial to infants by describing some of the realities of child care for infants in Massachusetts circa 1987. Randomly sampled were 750 Massachusetts families with children under 13. Respondents were interviewed by phone about child care arrangements and family demographics. Respondents were statistically representative of all families in the state that had at least one child under the age of 13. Interviewed families had a total of 1,281 children; of these, 252 were infants up to 2 years old. These 252 infants statistically represented the population of infants in the state in 1987. Findings concern: (1) maternal employment and child care; (2) hours of care; (3) the unmet need for infant child care; (4)  patterns of infant care; and (5) variations in the use of infant child care. Data revealed that both maternal employment and regular child care were the norm for older infants in Massachusetts in 1987, and were a common occurrence for infants up to 12 months of age. Almost half of infants' mothers were employed in the first year of the infant's life; over half were employed in the second year. Families with employed parents used several techniques to manage employment and child care. Married women were as likely as single mothers to use child care. Social class differences were found in the types of child care used. (RH)",

        "description":"Communication between parents and staff was observed in 16 proprietary day care centers during morning and afternoon transition times when parents dropped off children and picked them up. Results revealed large, stable differences among centers in the frequency and usefulness of these exchanges. About two-thirds of transition time opportunities resulted in parent-staff communication, the median length of such communications being 12 seconds. Analysis by time of day suggested that caregivers were relatively more accessible during the morning transition, while parents were relatively more accessible during the afternoon. There were also large differences in parent-staff communication in preschool versus infant-toddler programs that favored the younger age group in measures such as  frequency and usefulness. Follow-up analysis suggested that the age differences might be due more to the communication needs of infant-toddler staff than those of parents. (RH)",

The paper focuses on statements about teaching for understanding, higher order thinking, and problem solving. Part 1 addresses the historical and theoretical context of goals and practices in art and music education. Four currents of curriculum thought in general education are examined; these currents are: (1) subject matter or academic rationalism; (2) students or developmentalism; (3) social efficiency or social adaptation; and (4) social meliorism, reconstruction, or transformation. The first part also covers the ways in which these curricular currents are and have been manifested in art and music education, and the relationship of theoretical and curriculum orientations.  Part 2 addresses student understanding and critical thinking in art and music; creative thinking; the parameters of art and music as subjects of study; research findings related to human development in arts learning; and the implications of such findings for development of student understanding and critical thinking in the arts.

        "description":"The hypothesis that children are placed at increased risk for adjustment problems when parents divorce and remarry was tested with a sample of 206 boys in the fourth grade. It was also hypothesized that the relation of parenting transitions and boys' adjustment would be mediated by family management practices. Subjects attended schools in neighborhoods with a relatively high incidence of juvenile delinquency. A child adjustment construct was calculated from seven constructs: antisocial behavior, drug sampling, peer rejection, deviant peer association, poor academic skills, poor self-esteem, and depression. This global adjustment construct was plotted for four groups of subjects: (1) two biological parents; (2) single mothers; (3) stepfather families; and (4) single mother and  stepfather families. All other family types were excluded. Boys' adjustment was found to be related in a linear manner to the number of parental transitions. Boys in families who had experienced two or more transitions were at especially high risk for poor adjustment and later delinquency. The relation of child adjustment to parental transitions was partly accounted for by socioeconomic status and mediated by reduced parental monitoring. (RH)",

Discussion defines mixed-age grouping and examines some limitations of single-age grouping. Research findings on social and cognitive aspects of mixed-age grouping are reviewed. Social aspects are discussed by considering in turn the following statements: older children exhibit facilitative leadership, mixed-age grouping promotes prosocial behaviors, children appear to play as freely in mixed-age groups as in same-age groups, self-regulation appears to improve, social participation is heightened for younger children, older children create complex play for younger ones, older children operate well in younger children's zone of proximal development, and younger children allow  isolated older children social skills practice. The therapeutic effects of mixed age interaction are also considered. Cognitive aspects are discussed in terms of effective cognitive conflict resulting from peer interaction, complex aspects of cognitive conflict, novices and experts in mixed-age groups, and children's sensitive adjustment of communication for listeners. Additionally, successful multi-age programs and some effective teaching strategies are described, along with peer tutoring and cooperative learning. Concluding materials present recommendations for decision makers in schools and centers for young children. Suggestions for teachers implementing mixed-age grouping are appended.

Major sections of the paper address: (1) the nature of peer relations; (2) peer relations and risk; (3) developmental models; and (4) the role of caregivers and teachers in the development of early peer relations. A conjunctive model is advanced to account for the manner in which troubled family relations are followed by troubled peer relations, problems with  self-regard, narrowed alternatives in choosing friends, and manifestations of social deviance. Social adjustment is seen as deriving from a combination or conjunction of family and peer influences. The origins of conjunctive cycles appear to exist in early childhood and require attention in program implementation and management for young children. Nearly 50 references are cited. (RH)",

The pilot scheme sought to learn about the functioning of school boards before they came into statutory existence in the 1989-90 school year. The seven schools represented a cross-section of Regional schools and ranged from a one-teacher elementary school to an academy with about 1,000 students. Board membership comprised parents, teachers, and co-opted members. Initial assessment procedures included questionnaires completed by 27 of 29 parent members, observation of 11 board meetings, interviews with parents, teachers, and administrators involved with school boards, and analysis of board meeting minutes and other relevant documents. Assessment focused on parent  members' backgrounds, the experience of board membership to date, training, and election procedures. Major achievements of the pilot scheme's first four months were: (1) demonstrating community interest in the boards; (2) raising parental awareness of board activities through various communication strategies; (3) identification of training needs and dissemination of background information to board members by the Region; (4) establishment of regular patterns of meetings, with good attendance by all concerned; and (5) adaptation of Regional systems to provide the kinds of information that boards need. Problem areas included some parents' feelings that the boards were doing nothing and the absence of semiskilled and unskilled workers on the boards. (SV)",

The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory conducted a review of literature and a survey of rural educators in the Southwest concerning staff development in their schools. The survey represented an initial effort to describe the staff development activities that existed in rural small schools and the staff development activities that educators working at these schools actually preferred. A sample was drawn from Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, for survey purposes, and structured interviews were conducted with 20 teachers. Results of the survey indicated that 80% of the respondents regularly  participate in multiple staff development activities during the school year. The most frequent activities consist of one-shot lectures given by consultants from outside the district with little follow-up provided for the participants. The data also suggest that staff development activities are not typically planned and initiated at the local level, but from the top down, perhaps reflecting the fact that staff development is not based on local needs. While the data suggest strong tendencies towards episodic staff development, there are also signs of an emerging locally driven system as well. Topics covered were wide-ranging, from the basic to the controversial. The topics considered most relevant were those that offer immediately useful materials, or specific, directly applicable skills.  Survey information is presented in 12 data tables. This document contains 31 references and a copy of the Staff Development Questionnaire. (ALL)",

This guidebook provides extension educators and economic development specialists with a starting point in designing workshops for local leaders interested in increasing economic activity in their communities. Workshop materials have been used in several pilot workshops and found to be adaptable to different regions and audiences. The workshop covers seven general areas, each of which may be taught as an independent unit or omitted, depending on community needs. These topical areas are: rural economic development overview, building an economic development strategy, economic development alternatives, financing economic development, impact  analysis, infrastructure, and public policy.

        "description":"This report examines the causes and effects of Appalachian poverty, focusing on education, unemployment, social services, and economic development. The data in the report were extracted from the 1980 U.S. Census. Although there has been a steady decline in Appalachian poverty rates since the landmark 1964 declaration of a War on Poverty, statistics show the picture of a region that remains much poorer than the rest of the nation. In 1980, prior to a major recession, the Central Appalachian Subregion had a poverty rate that was nearly double the national average. High numbers of people live just above the poverty line and are thus highly vulnerable to economic disruption. Some improvements can be attributed to expanded public spending, but persistent poverty rates reflect a  continuously isolated, inaccessible, undiversified, and dependent economy. In such conditions, there is little incentive for individual effort toward advancement. Education, for example, offers little reward in an area with few jobs. The persistence of poverty indicates the need for programs whose intervention strategies are designed to target isolated rural economies and their vulnerable populations. Programs of the past have sometimes enjoyed limited success and, in other instances, have failed spectacularly. This report concludes that, if the future is to learn from the past, rural economic strategies should be based on a realistic appreciation of the needs and abilities of rural residents. In the meantime, the costs of failure to find solutions to poverty remain high for individuals  and their communities. This report includes a section on the measurement of poverty with an emphasis on the Orshansky method. Ten charts and graphs offer detailed demographic information. (TES)",

        "description":"This paper describes the organization, implementation, and outcomes of a joint effort between the Regional Laboratory for Educational Improvement of the Northeast and Islands and the Vermont State Department of Education's Database Project. In 1987, the Laboratory proposed a feasibility study to examine the means and costs of accessing comprehensive sets of data regarding rural schooling within a single state. Vermont was selected as the study site because the Vermont Legislature had included a mandate and funding for the development of a unified educational database. The Laboratory's Rural Initiative proposal specified two objectives related to Vermont's development of a statewide database: (1) to observe and document the challenges faced by Vermont in its effort to create the  database to better understand the nature of challenges that other rural states will face as they mount similar efforts, and to identify the kinds of assistance that seem most helpful; and (2) to assist in solving problems and finding solutions throughout the development process. The plan called for a 6 month effort, July through December, 1987, to identify current data elements in 4 categories (student, staff, school, and district) and to specify hardware and software requirements. Implementation of the unified database began in January, 1988. Results of the initiative and the problems encountered are reported, as well as the &quot;on-hold&quot; status of the project as of August, 1988. (ALL)",

        "description":"Decreasing enrollments and financial problems have led to considerable restructuring in North Dakota schools. One form of restructuring was the creation of dual-role administrative positions combining two or all of the roles of superintendent, elementary principal, and secondary principal. In 1987, 47 of 51 administrators holding such positions completed a survey covering duties, certification, training, time allocation, advantages, problems, and possible solutions. Most respondents held proper credentials for all positions, performed duties in addition to administration, and received no extra pay. The major problem with the dual role was lack of time to do all tasks adequately; when the superintendency was one of the roles, the principalship was likely to be neglected. Other  problems included missing important professional meetings and workshops due to lack of a substitute, excessive supervisory responsibility, stress, and a somewhat weak job description regarding time allocation per area of responsibility. Most respondents listed advantages of the dual role, particularly greater involvement with students and teachers, greater awareness of needs of K-12, and cost savings. This report contains 20 references, 11 tables, the survey questionnaire, descriptions of administrator qualifications and credentials in North Dakota, and a literature review on administrator roles.

        "author":["Morehouse, Diane L."],
        "description":"This study evaluates interactive television (ITV) demonstration projects placed in Minnesota schools to minimize educational inequities between small, large, urban, and suburban districts. The basic data gathered for the first evaluation included exploratory interviews, document reviews, and case studies. The study found significant implementation delays caused by technical planning, negotiations of inter-district and inter-agency agreements, fundraising, and other factors. Student achievement analyses showed no consistent statistically significant difference in test scores. The paper concludes that the television medium and delivery of course content had no significant impact on student achievement levels. A great deal of interaction between students and teachers during the  televised deliveries was observed, and students expressed very favorable attitudes toward the ITV classes. Teachers also expressed generally favorable attitudes about the technology, although they offered caveats involving participation and preparation. The implementation of ITV systems affects school districts in at least three ways: (1) it requires and promotes cooperation among districts; (2) it permits districts to offer an enlarged curriculum; and (3) it provides opportunities for expanded community and adult education. Minnesota's demonstration program has allowed, at least in the short term, the continued independent survival of a number of school districts that would otherwise have been forced to consolidate their programs.

        "description":"Educators are always dealing with subcultures, whether or not they are labeled as such. The distinguishing elements of a subculture are the values behind observable cultural traits. Each person belongs to one or more subcultures, and the values ascribed either by the subculture to itself or by the greater culture to that subset have continual impact upon a person's world view, which, in turn, influences the individual's responses in a learning situation. Educators often believe that they can effectively enter a subculture, albeit through acculturation. Outsiders, however, may be accepted, but rarely do they achieve full member status within the group. Subcultural values and beliefs remain abstract as non-members have not had the necessary personal experiences to understand fully  the symbolism and history behind them. Understanding the inherent barriers can provide an educator with the tools necessary for sharing knowledge with any subcultural group. A client-centered approach to providing educational opportunities to adult members of a subculture allows the educator to act as facilitator to a group of subcultural representatives as they identify their own educational needs. A short role-playing exercise provides graduate students or adult education practitioners with exposure to some of the issues encountered when a member of the greater culture seeks to develop an educational program for a subcultural group. This report contains 18 references and instructions for the exercise. (SV)",

        "description":"Rural communities in the West have lost jobs in traditional (i.e., resource based) industries, a change that has prompted a search for new employment opportunities. High-tech manufacturing has been the focus of considerable attention because of its potential for continued rapid growth. Many high-tech industries are dispersing geographically to small urban areas and nonmetropolitan counties. The growth, employment, and decentralization characteristics of high-tech manufacturing industries indicate their potential to generate employment opportunities in nonmetropolitan economies. This report, the product of a study that surveyed 280 high-tech and 301 low-tech establishments in nonmetropolitan counties in 11 western states presents the following conclusions: (1) small towns and  rural counties are not at any particular disadvantage although greater percentages of large plants and branch plants locate in metropolitan-adjacent counties; (2) high-tech plants generate as many jobs as traditional plants; (3) the structure of occupations differs between high-tech and low-tech and between branch and single unit plants; (4) high-tech plants employ higher percentages of women, concentrated in lower skilled production occupations; and (5) high-tech plants purchase a lower percentage of local nonlabor inputs than low-tech plants. Statistical data are reported in tables and graphs. A list of high technology industries is included as an appendix. This report contains 10 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"The flight of middle class families from the cities to the suburbs has left many cities hard pressed to continue services at former levels. Falling enrollments and revenues have led to mergers of city and county school districts or closures of city districts followed by county takeover. This report documents educators' experience of city-county school consolidation, with special attention to educator morale. Administrators of five North Carolina and Tennessee school districts that had undergone consolidation completed a preliminary questionnaire. Teachers and administrators from five consolidated districts in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee took part in hour-long telephone interviews based on the questionnaire. Five key factors affected or reflected educator morale before  or during consolidation: (1) the extent of planning and of educator involvement in the planning process; (2) communications about consolidation; (3) fears about job security, transfers, inequitable treatment, and loss of benefits and special programs; (4) the actual events that occurred during implementation; and (5) educator grievances and departures. The districts surveyed ran the gamut from minimal loss of educator morale to major trauma for educators. Recommendations for educators and community members facing consolidation include: (1) extensive planning that involves boards of education, educators, and community members from both districts; (2) extensive communications among all interested parties to counteract rumors and groundless fears; and (3) strong leadership from  superintendents and community leaders. This report contains 15 references. Appendices include the survey instruments, and merger chronologies for Charlotte and Mecklenburg County (North Carolina), Nashville and Davidson County (Tennessee), Winston-Salem and Forsyth County (North Carolina), Louisville and Jefferson County (Kentucky), and Knoxville and Knox County (Tennessee).

        "description":"West Virginia is recognized as the second most sparsely populated state in the nation. Legislation that intended to upgrade the quality of education in the state was passed in 1988. Some educational leaders argued that statewide reform must consider the uniqueness of sparse, rural school districts in the state, taking into account issues such as sparsity of population, rough terrain, inadequate roads, limited fiscal and human resources, and a general inequity of educational opportunity. On December 20, 1988, the State Superintendent of Schools, Tom McNeel, appointed a special task force on rural school districts. The task force was charged with the responsibility of determining the unique and special needs of rural school districts in the state and to propose solutions dealing  with the problems of these school districts. Of West Virginia's 55 counties, 25 counties were identified as sparse, with 10 or fewer students per square mile. Counties in this category have between 1.63 and 8.93 students per square mile with an average of 5.15, compared to an average of 22.68 in the other 30 counties and the state average of 13.48. The task force addressed the following characteristics and needs: (1) per capita income; (2) unemployment; (3) economic factors; (4) special education; (5) curriculum and instruction; (6) school finance; and (7) impact of education reform legislation. Twelve specific recommendations are listed to help sparsely populated counties better serve students. Statistical data are presented in table form throughout the report.

        "author":["Gutierrez, Lorraine"],
        "description":"Theories of empowerment propose how individuals can increase their personal, interpersonal, and political power in order to take action to improve their lives. Empowerment requires development of a new self-concept composed of three mutually reinforcing cognitive components: (1) group identification; (2) stratum consciousness; and (3) self- and collective efficacy. This study investigates the initial development of empowerment in the Chicano community, which is composed of new immigrants and descendants of natives, English and Spanish speakers, and includes heritage- and nonheritage-oriented individuals. The empowerment process may be difficult to implement among Chicanos because of this heterogeneity. Ethnic identity is multidimensional and has two major dimensions, cultural and  political. Factor and multiple classification analyses were conducted on data from the &quot;Mexican Origin People in the United States: The 1979 Chicano Study&quot; which drew a sample of 991 persons of Mexican descent living in the Southwest and in Chicago, Illinois. The purpose of the survey was to test three hypotheses: (1) social identity in Chicanos will take one of two forms, cultural or political; (2) cultural identity will be associated with immigrant status, Spanish dominance, lower education, and high ingroup/low outgroup contact; and (3) political identity will be associated with native born status, English dominance, higher education, and high ingroup/high outgroup contact. The first two hypotheses were supported by analyses of the data. Results of the study suggest that immigrant  Chicanos may develop a sense of ethnic identity more readily and engage in the process of empowerment more easily than native born Chicanos.

In addition, seven science education researchers have provided responses to critiques of their published research. Included are: (1) an analysis of an article designed to persuade researchers to abandon Piagetian psychology in favor of the alternative conceptions movement as the psychological framework for science education research (Gilbert and Swift); (2) a report of a study designed to see if the strength of the relationship between student performance and the presence/absence of manipulative models in a testing situation varied with student reasoning level (Staver and Halsted); (3) a study to document students' ideas or  conceptual frameworks and to investigate the consistency with which the ideas were used by individuals in different contexts (Clough and Driver); (4) a report which deals with the testing of the ability of several learning theory models to explain college students' performance on drill and practice microcomputer programs in chemistry (Zitzewitz and Berger); (5) a second report describes the investigation and the effects of concept-related instructional organization and locus of control orientation on meaningful learning achievement (Sherris and Kahle); and (6) a study which reports on the relative effectiveness of two hypothesis-testing strategies (disconfirmation, confirmation) using games (Gorman). In the Responses to Critiques section, Yore, Dreyfus, Hill, and Lawrenz provide reactions  to articles critiqued in past issues. Responses from Clough and Driver, Staver, and Berger relate to critiques contained within this issue. (CW)",

It is suggested that microcomputer simulations are at least as effective as hands-on experiences for some cognitive outcomes and may in fact enhance these outcomes when the simulations are sequenced to follow hands-on instruction. Skills such as graphing appear to be positively influenced by microcomputer-based experiences, although the apparently critical nature of a delay between the input of data and its corresponding graphic display should be noted. While sex difference in achievement may not have been eliminated by the use of the microcomputer, instances of equal performance have been noted. In the affective domain, both student attitudes and interest  seem to be positive regarding the use of microcomputers in science instruction. Includes 10 references. (MVL)",

These students should see that the study of science is not confined to the classroom but offers a way to investigate and understand the curious phenomena to be found in the every-day world. Similarly, mathematics is not only the scientist's primary tool but also a world of its own full of curious phenomena. This publication lists contests and fairs for  individuals and teams; extracurricular opportunities for students in California; and professional recognition, awards, grants, professional growth and development programs, and affiliations for teachers in California.

A teaching experiment was designed to create an ideal context in which the pedagogical approach to errors as springboards could be applied constantly. The teaching experiment was organized as 10 lessons on mathematical definitions for two 11th-grade female students. Twenty mathematical errors were recorded and analyzed. The error activities identified and described are different from learning goals and outcomes. A taxonomy of constructive uses of errors was developed based on level of mathematics discourse and stance of learning. Eight potential benefits associated with  errors as springboards were generated from the analysis of error activities. (YP)",

It was written for grades 4-6 but many activities may also be of interest for use with older students. This curriculum covers both marine and freshwater habitats. Each of five sections addresses a question about water which is then answered by a variety of activities using an experimental, science process approach to enable the students themselves to arrive at answers. Each section is preceded by teachers' information with science content related to the activities written for the teacher. The emphasis for the students is on process rather than on content. In addition to experiments and classification activities, several exercises test the application of basic  principles through the development of models. Following each exercise, extension activities enable students to pursue a variety of related topics. Some allow students to apply the results of their experiments to specific environmental problems. Supporting materials offer information on preparation of materials and sources of supplies. Worksheets and information sheets may be used directly or may be replaced by materials prepared by the teacher. The review of what science education research says about the \"hands-on\" approach to teaching elementary science will help teachers understand the emphasis on process.

Subjects were participants in a special mathematics anxiety program. Beliefs are classified as instrumental and relational approaches to a situation. Emotion is also distinguished as a two-faceted construct which includes the physiological arousal (emotion as state) and the cognitive construction (emotion as acts). Perceptions of participants are described in detail to illustrate the nature of shifts in beliefs about mathematics and to elaborate on a framework for interpreting the relationship between mathematical beliefs and emotional acts. Some cases of individuals who made no change and became more anxious as the program progressed  are discussed. Anxiety is not an inherent response to mathematics, but is based on an individual's beliefs about mathematical activity. (YP)",

The think-aloud interview led to the identification of several specific program exploration and prediction behaviors. A total of 14 high school biology students made predictions concerning the effects of the independent variables upon dependent variables through time using a computer simulation on water pollution. Students were identified according to initial knowledge of the subject matter and success at solving three selected prediction problems. Successful predictors generally had high initial knowledge of the subject matter and were formal. Unsuccessful predictors generally had low initial knowledge of the subject matter and  were concrete. High initial knowledge seemed to be more important to predictive success than stage of Piagetian cognitive development. Behavioral tendencies between successful and unsuccessful predictors over all stages of the learning sequence and between stage one and stage three predictions were compared. Implications for problem-solving theory, cognitive development, and science teaching were discussed. (Author/YP)",

        "description":"This paper, one of a series considering eight disciplines, describes historical developments and current thinking in mathematics concerning what ought to be included in the elementary school mathematics curriculum. The first part of this paper is devoted to a discussion of the previous involvement of mathematicians in curriculum reform projects. The second part reviews only the most notable of these projects, the School Mathematics Study Group, then gives a few general remarks and discusses the Comprehensive School Mathematics Project. The third part speculates on the future content of the elementary curriculum, the integrated curriculum, and applications including problem solving. The fourth part addresses the question of important content. While the elementary mathematics  curriculum is and should remain mostly arithmetic, including estimation, probability, statistics, and use of hand-held calculators, it should also include other topics such as geometry and spatial visualization, logical deduction, problem solving, and something on the nature of mathematics. The final section is a sample unit on area at about the fifth- or sixth-grade level. The unit builds from properties of area to the area of triangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids. The unit contains some sample exercises, but is not entirely self-contained. (Author/YP)",

        "author":["Gans, Curtis B."],
        "description":"If one counts both the mid-term and presidential elections, the United States has had the lowest voter turnout of any democracy in the world. In the 1986 election, only 16.6% of the eligible 18-24 year olds voted, and although final census surveys for that year are not yet published, it is unlikely that the turnout for that age group would have risen to a level of more than 30%. While in the 1970's the dominant attitude of non-voters was alienation, studies show the current attitude seems to be indifference. This poses a distinct danger for U.S. democracy in the future. Research is needed on child development and socialization, and on curricula and stimuli throughout the child's formative years. Research is also needed to determine the cause of the embarrassingly low percentage  of participation by young voters in the electoral process, and what sets them apart from that much larger group that declines to participate. The effects of television on the perceptions and knowledge structure of students should also be reviewed. Regardless of the attempts made by educators in addressing these problems, until the nation addresses some of the larger issues of the political framework, such as ethical standards in politics and the obfuscatory nature of election campaigns, educators will have little impact on the system or on the students. The paper also includes a three page dialog among graduating seniors on the nature of good citizenship. (PPB)",

        "description":"One of seven review/synthesis papers prepared to help frame the research program of the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Elementary Subjects, this paper describes historical developments and current issues in curriculum, instruction, and evaluation in elementary social studies, with emphasis on teaching for understanding and higher order applications of the content. Leading scholars and organizations concerned with elementary level social education have developed statements on teaching for understanding and for higher order thinking and problem solving in the social studies. It is concluded that (1) the higher order goals of instruction in social studies are comparable to those of instruction in other subjects, at least if they are described in a few basic terms (such as  conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and inquiry) rather than decomposed into long lists of partial skills, but (2) values, dispositions, and appreciation and self-actualization goals need to be considered along with more conventionally described knowledge and skills goals. The emphasis on citizen education as the transcendent purpose of social studies means that the higher order goals of social studies curricula focus more on personal and civic decision making than on the knowledge generation and problem-solving paradigms pursued in the social sciences and also that there is a strong emphasis on the values and dispositions involved in preparing students to become active participants in a democratic society.

An effort has been made to include a variety of methods and ideas, ranging from very simple descriptive exercises that can be completed by the average student in a few minutes to more challenging analytical problems that might require several days or even weeks to complete. The concepts addressed are: scarcity, opportunity cost and trade-offs, productivity, the market system, supply and demand,  competition and market structure, income distribution, profit, capital formation, the role of government, and economic tools.

This study presents information regarding the earning and labor market success of artists in the United States as of 1980. Results are presented for many different subgroups of artists. After outlining introductory information in section 1, section 2 outlines the data used and points out a number of possible mechanisms for reconciling the diverse findings of previous work. Section 3 presents overall results concerning earnings of artists. This is followed in section 4 through section 8 by results for various subgroups of artists defined  by place of residence, race and sex, marital status, education, self-employment status, and age. Section 9 contains regression equations prediction earnings of artists and comparison groups of other workers. The study reveals that the labor market differs widely across various types of artists, and it is difficult to establish what determines financial success. The findings are presented by 24 figures and 57 tables. Data are derived from 1980 U.S. Census figures. Sixteen references are given. (PPB)",

        "description":"The long-range goal of the Twin Lakes/Purdue project is to establish a collaborative site where college students can observe and practice teaching behaviors that enhance thinking skills and facilitate cognitive growth. A more immediate objective is to help teachers at the site develop teaching strategies which enhance thinking in the content area of social studies. Efforts have been focused on helping these teachers make a transition from conventional teaching to teaching guided by a research based instruction model. According to the model, instruction is initiated through confrontations, experiences which are emotionally compelling and open to a variety of interpretations. These questions which the teacher asks should help the students seek explanatory relationships. This will  lead to using resources beyond the textbooks as the inquiry unfolds. Teachers must encourage students to pursue their own emerging lines of inquiry in this process. The accomplishments and positive aspects of this close relationship between university and school are discussed, as are the difficulties in implementing such programs that force teachers to confront their instructional assumptions and strategies. The aim of this process is to develop the students' abilities to attain skills that will enable them to encounter their environment, probe and process the information discovered, build new constructs, and reorganize the cognitive structure. Student questionnaires, 44 references, and profiles of components of the program are included. (PPB)",

        "description":"According to the document, Dr. Andrew Brimmer did an excellent job of identifying emerging economic concerns. Dr. Brimmer's characterization of economics as a tool kit can help young people examine important social questions using principles of economics as the tool for analysis. One way to build an economics tool kit is by placing more stress on the basic premises of economics. These premises can be thought of as a set of generalizations about economic behavior which students can use to analyze current concerns such as the economics of national health insurance or the economics of pricing natural resources. The tool kit should provide students with answers to their questions. Three values derived from the discipline of economics might be worthy of inclusion in a citizenship  education program. These values are as follows: (1) individuals are responsible for their own actions; (2) private property builds freedom and personal responsibility; and (3) people should not impose unwanted costs on others. Conference participants were asked to examine the papers presented and identify examples of how the ideas could translate into good teaching or be developed into sound instructional material. More specific examples are needed to help translate these powerful new ideas into meaningful classroom instruction. (GEA)",

Research planning is conceived of as a resource allocation decision in which resources are being allocated to activities directed toward the solution of basic scientific problems. A structuralist representation of scientific knowledge will be employed to provide a relatively precise characterization of a basic scientific problem. The main thrust of the analysis consists in describing various ways in which values enter into those decisions. Distinction is made between internal and external values operating in these decisions. The discussion focuses on exploiting this representation of  knowledge in a manner which will illuminate the scientific value of solving certain basic problems. A micro-economic approach to the problem of resource allocation suggests that it may be fully understood in terms of values (or utilities) and probabilities attached to the solution of the problems by the decision makers.

        "description":"This paper summarizes the suggestions offered by investigative committees of U.S. historians from the 1880s to the present concerning the importance of studying history in public schools, what should be included, and how it should be taught. An integrative approach to learning, combining history with English and geography, as suggested in reports issued before the advent of social studies, has been the optimal choice. Since history's traditional role in the schools has always included the responsibility for inculcating citizenship, instructional strategies that encourage students to be aware of their own rights and responsibilities are favored and should have a multicultural, global perspective. An integrated approach that discards traditional notions of content, classroom time,  subject differentiation, and teacher training--outlined both conceptually and by example--offers opportunities for exciting children's imagination and encourages enjoyment in learning. However, it makes very little difference in the long run what happens in the classroom if educational reform is not accompanied by a sincere questioning of how our society is structured and the values it promotes.

        "description":"The concept of owning knowledge is somewhat ethereal and until recently had little relevance to academic institutions. In principle any object that is capable of being controlled is capable of being owned. The most basic control concerns decisions about whether to communicate knowledge. The philosophical foundation which is the basis of the legal recognition of intellectual property in the United States is Article One, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, &quot;Progress of Science and Useful Arts.&quot; Underlying the system is, as the U.S. Supreme Court has stated, &quot;the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&quot; At issue is what kind of knowledge should have exclusive ownership  rights, and under what conditions. Patent laws do not protect basic scientific discoveries but only the method for making practical use of them. While there may be some reasons for not recognizing proprietary rights in theoretical knowledge, one may suspect that the main arguments against such recognition relate to resulting complex administrative problems. The proprietary view of knowledge could have a very damaging effect both on the way scientists share information and on how topics are selected for research. The time has come when universities have to establish policies regulating the exploitation for personal gain of knowledge obtained while doing scientific research as a member of a university community.

        "description":"Synergistic psychology has been proposed as a meta theory for synthesizing different psychological theories into an explanation of how social, cognitive, and biological factors interact in human behavior. The basic theoretical assumption in synergistic psychology is that internalized social interactions become higher mental functions that regulate lower biological functions. The synthesis of psychoanalytic and Vygotskian theories can be woven around six common issues: (1) the interaction of thought and language in cognition; (2) the role of adults as mediators of infant's early object manipulations; (3) the role of internalized social interactions in the regulation of thought; (4) the collaboration of imagination and logical thought in creative thinking; (5) the role of nonverbal  unconscious thought in cognition; and (6) the role of internalized social interactions involving speech and object manipulations in the development of self-concept and world view. The teaching of studio art involves the two domains of the craft of art and the conceptual processes of artistic activity. While some may suggest that creativity is a natural attribute of most people that will manifest itself if allowed to do so in a laissez faire manner, the synergistic approach suggests that what is needed is a developmental model of teaching creative problem solving with maximal social interaction and collaboration with the teacher. Future research will investigate the effects of social interaction with adults on the child's object substitutions in play. A reference list of 18 items is  included. (PPB)",

Unit 3 focuses on macroeconomics and includes the following topics: measuring the economy; money; unemployment, inflation, and distribution of income; government decisions that affect unemployment and inflation; the criteria of a &quot;good&quot; tax; and economic growth as a national policy goal. Unit 4 reviews reasons for international trade, characteristics of alternative economic systems, economic problems of developing nations, and the economics of population growth, resource scarcity or imbalance, and economic growth.

Geographic education provides the values, knowledge, concepts, and skills to better understand ourselves, our relationship to the earth, and our interdependence with other peoples of the world. There is a great need to increase the quantity and quality of geographic education in elementary schools to overcome ignorance of geography. Place names and locations are stressed in elementary geography, as are map and globe skills and the recognition of physical landforms appearing on maps. Teachers promote the study of geography through one or more teaching strategies: personal experiences, textbooks and printed media, and interactive computer software. Most geography is taught as a part of social  studies and only a small portion of the day is spent in the study of these subjects. As a result, students' concepts of geography are severely limited and sometimes non-existent. The Guidelines for Geographic Education provide help in the selection of objectives and organization of geographic knowledge for elementary students. Five geographic themes are recommended for study by students at all levels: location, place, human and environment relationships, movement, and regions. Geography instruction is necessary in elementary schools. Geographers, geographic resources, and teachers must meet at state and district-level workshops to improve instruction. Emphasis must be placed upon understanding the context and importance of the five major themes of geographic education. Teachers must be  taught to emphasize questioning, analyzing, verifying, and evaluating geographic information. A 10-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

Questions raised, together with some salient points made in the discussion of each, are as follows: (1) What is the background to current debates about curriculum reform in world history? The current confusion about world history courses reflects conflicting curricula traditions and the lack of a uniform image of what world history is or should be. (2) Should teachers emphasize the history of the West or of the world? Although U.S. society is based in the Western experience, citizens no longer live in a world dominated by the West. (3) Should social or political  history be emphasized in the curriculum? While the different perspectives of social or political history may lead to divergent approaches, they should be viewed as complementary possibilities for the teacher to explore. (4) Should world history teachers use the survey approach? Major elements of a chronological survey can be treated thematically, but in a chronological order, thus linking together historical periods while encouraging historical thinking skills. (5) Should world history be taught in a single year? A multi-year world history sequence is an ideal, but it may be difficult to implement. A list of nine references on issues related to the world history curriculum concludes the digest. (PPB)",

Vital services are provided through thousands of organizations created to meet needs not otherwise provided for by government. Participation in these community service projects help create a sense of concern for the public good and a commitment to voluntarism so essential to the future of the United States. Students at every level of school can participate in these projects and thus learn many social studies skills, including data gathering, critical thinking, and decision making. Community service programs also teach civic participation processes and skills, including group interaction, leadership, cooperation, and political  influence. Service activities build positive bonds between youth and the institutions of our society and strengthen student academic performance and self-esteem. Service brings together students from diverse ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups. Fourteen characteristics of exemplary community service programs are cited, including the principles that: (1) community service must meet genuine needs; (2) it must have real consequences; and (3) it must require significant personal responsibility and decision making. Five nationally recognized school-based programs are given as examples of ongoing community service programs that teachers and curriculum specialists might study. A 13-item bibliography is included.

        "description":"This paper explores the habits of isolation that teacher educators bring from previous lives as teachers, administrators, and students who have been part of typically individualistic and competitive K-12, undergraduate, and graduate schooling. The paper also addresses the lack of communication inside teacher education programs that isolates the instructors, teaching assistants, supervisors, and cross-campus department advisors. It is noted that reckoning with these issues is crucial to successful work in collaborative partnerships and that it is important that teacher educators address the stereotype of the \"ivory tower\" and the embarrassment of disparagements of teacher education curriculum as being too remote from the practical reality of the classroom. There is a need to  conduct honest dialogue about the tension between teacher educators and school people, in which school personnel see themselves as dealing with reality and see teacher educators as inhabiting a scholastic retreat from practical problems.

        "description":"A system of evaluation which generates copious information with minimal demands on teachers and administrators can improve the quality of teacher assessment while lowering the tensions associated with the process. Multiple-Strategies Model for Effective Teaching is made up of 10 component parts. Each component represents an element in a framework upon which effective instruction can be built. Based on teaching effectiveness research and classroom practice, the model has proven effective in training and retraining teachers and is now proving highly useful as an inservice teacher evaluation device. Because the model prescribes several specific elements such as objectives, justification, and evaluation, teachers can retain the plans in which these elements are designated as evidence  that they are using the preferred system on a regular basis. When the model is used as a standard, the assessor can suggest that a teacher focus greater attention on a particular area. When teachers meet or exceed the standard, they can be rewarded appropriately; if they fail to reach the standard, they can be directed toward specific improvement based on the model. The components covered in the model are: (1) classroom climate; (2) opening lessons; (3) instructional objectives; (4) justification of content; (5) selection of content; (6) teaching strategies; (7) review of material; (8) lesson evaluation; (9) student achievement evaluation; and (10) classroom management.

The purpose was also to discover any significant differences between the dance attitudes of French Canadian children taught by a &quot;home&quot; teacher (French speaking) or by a &quot;foreign&quot; teacher (English speaking) after participation in four dance sessions. Neal's Dance Attitude Inventory (1985) was used to collect data. Subjects were girls (N=50) and boys (N=56) enrolled in co-educational third-grade classes at two schools in Quebec, Canada. The total score range was 30 to 120, with scores of 12 to 48 in the affective and the cognitive domains and 6 to 24 in the behavioral domain. Significant shifts between pretest and posttest scores were found in the English group; and in the  cognitive domain for girls and boys in the French group and for boys in the control group. The results lend support to attitude research which discriminates between domains because a shift in one psychological domain does not mean that there will be a shift in other domains. The study also provides support for a shift in subjects' affective dance attitudes due to direct participation whether or not the teacher speaks the native language of the subjects. (JD)",

To improve the quality of individual inservice components of the plan, the legislature mandated increased consultant-teacher contact time for most inservice components. The non-credit, inservice activities offered through teacher education centers are identified and matched with university resources by contracts. The human resources of institutions of higher education are utilized to deliver staff improvement activities to meet district needs. A brief description is given of three models for the delivery of staff development that have  served to effect growth in teacher competencies and the academic achievement of students. In one, full-time faculty are employed to fulfill identified staff development needs in two county school systems. Hired as a result of assessment of the school system's needs, these faculty members provide full-time consultant services and technical assistance in a variety of district program areas. Another model is designed to meet identified staff development needs by means of individualized, clinical-based staff development. The third model provides topic-specific workshops and conferences to help education personnel on a short-term basis. (JD)",

The research methodology employed is a model of in-depth phenominological interviewing which operates on the assumption that one makes meaning of his or her experience after reflecting on the constitutive details of that experience. Three 90-minute, in-depth interviews, spaced approximately one week apart, are conducted with  each participant. The initial findings indicate that the student teaching cohort and the support of the mentors and university staff do help to ameliorate some of the inherent frustrations associated with student teaching. For the mentors, participation in the clinical site is proving to be a valuable mechanism for providing intellectual and professional renewal. (Author)",

Teacher incentive programs have the potential to affect over 2 million public school teachers. This report on a national survey of public schools conducted in the 1984-85 school year, is designed to provide baseline data on teacher incentive programs that current and future research can use to estimate the changes that may be occurring in this area. The first section of the report discusses characteristics of schools that do and that do not have teacher incentive programs, and the types of programs most and least likely to be present in schools. The second section examines  characteristics of teachers who work in schools with and without incentive programs. The third section explores the usefulness of the administrators' ratings on the effectiveness of each incentive program. The following are samples of the findings discussed in this report: (1) In 1984-85, about 38 percent of all public schools offered one or more teacher incentive programs, compared with 18 percent in school year 1983-84; (2) Less than half (42 percent) of all public school teachers worked in schools which offered one or more teacher incentive program; (3) Large schools are more likely to offer teacher incentive programs than small schools; (4) Schools with higher proportions of minority students are more likely to offer incentive programs than schools with lower proportions of minority  students; (5) Minority teachers are more likely to work in schools offering teacher incentive programs than white, non-Hispanic teachers.

        "description":"Fuller's theoretical model of concerns was the conceptual framework used in studying concerns, problems, and stress levels of three cohorts of interns undergoing transition into teaching. Independent variables examined included undergraduate grade point averages, subject area specializations, age, and personality. Subjects were fifth-year beginning teachers seeking licensure through a non-degree alternative program. All completed a year-long internship in public schools. Concerns data were obtained in summer, fall, and spring; weekly problems and stress were observed at four times during the school year. Concern levels were statistically different at various points in time with self-concerns high in the summer and management concerns most evident in the fall. Impact concerns  generally increased in the spring semester. Variations found between the three cohorts are attributed to program modifications and increased induction support emerging over the three year period. Some differences were found among concern levels according to age, undergraduate grade point averages, subject areas taught, and personality factors. No differences were noted for stress levels and weekly problems. The findings support the idea that the year-long internship and transition support can be effective in assisting beginning teachers in moving through the developmental stages of learning to teach.

        "description":"Selected findings are presented of a 2-year evaluation study of the impact of three different staff development summer institutes on the use of new teaching materials and interactive strategies by 96 teachers. The purpose of the study was to explore some of the individual and organizational factors that are associated with the adoption of new teaching practices. Change was measured in terms of teachers' self-reported degree of use of international education materials, degree of use of interactive teaching strategies, interest in learning or improving their knowledge of interactive teaching strategies, and perceptions of competence on the use of new materials and teaching strategies. The individual factors examined included: (1) gender and grade level taught; (2) degree of  previous experience with and/or interest in learning or using international education materials and/or interactive teaching strategies; and (3) perceived competence in these areas. Organizational factors analyzed included: (1) existant support structure for the teacher implementing change, as measured by the existence of school and/or district teams working together to implement international education programs; (2) teachers' perception of support; and (3) number of contact hours in the training programs. Analysis of the data confirmed the power of organizational linkages between the teachers, the school and the resource center as factors that support change. Teachers' perceptions of competence with regard to the use of international education materials and strategies appeared to be an  important factor in understanding their internalization of innovations introduced by this program.

The paper has four sections. The first is a sketch of one interpretation of Schon's theoretical approach. The second examines selected appraisals of the more general features of Schon's work. The third section focuses on his two concepts of reflection which seem to have been misinterpreted by some who use his work. The fourth section focuses on the concept of &quot;reframing&quot;, which is taken to be central to Schon's account of the development of professional knowledge. The discussion moves toward identifying theoretical and empirical questions that have been raised, and by the appraisals noted in the second section. The paper's responses  to these appraisals is the starting point for speculations about the directions that might be taken to further understanding of the conditions that promote teachers' professional knowledge.

Careful attention of how one describes the world appears to give clues as to how one constructs it. Such constructions can come under scrutiny only when one speaks or writes, and then attends to the language one has used. A brief description is presented of a research program into the character and development of professional knowledge. It is demonstrated how looking for one's own metaphors can be expected to reveal something of one's professional knowledge. This is a necessary part of productive reflection upon teaching practice. In considering \"reflection-in-action\" it is pointed out that this is occasioned by the puzzles of practice, and an important  part of the process is known as \"reframing.\" Reframing describes the familiar part of the process in which an event over which someone has puzzled for some time suddenly is \"seen\" differently and in a way that suggests new approaches to the puzzle. An analysis is presented of interviews with two teachers in which their use of metaphors provided clues as to how they think about teaching. (JD)",

A discussion is presented on the interaction of propositional knowledge (the basic medium of classroom and research knowledge) and practical knowledge (the observable competence apparent in successful professional actions). Alternative definitions of professional expertise are examined prior to taking a close look at the issue of learning from experience, using data provided by several of the teachers who participated in the study. An analysis of how teachers learn from experience takes into consideration four broad principals of expertise: discrete technical skills, application of theory or general principles, critical analysis, and deliberate  action. Summaries are presented of interviews with five teachers, of whom one was a preservice teacher, two were beginning teachers, and two were experienced teachers with Master of Education degrees. Data selected from the interviews suggest that there are tensions associated with the differences between research knowledge and practical knowledge and that this is a significant problem for beginning teachers.

Respondents were asked to rate their level of support for 21 reform proposals on a scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Frequency statistics revealed various levels of support for specific reform proposals. Areas receiving strongest support included higher teacher salaries, mentor teachers to assist and supervise beginning teachers, and more state funding for educational programs. Undesirable reforms included  longer school days, and use of standardized tests for evaluating both students and prospective teachers.

Both participants were female educational administrators. In the course of the pilot study, the participants met for a series of seven interviews, each lasting approximately 1 hour. The first six interviews occurred over a 3-week period. A key element of the interview process involved the charting of decision points in the life history. A decision flowchart was developed depicting the sequence of activities and choices that the  interviewee had related. The chart was present at each session. The seventh interview occurred 2 months after the sixth interview. During the intervening period, the researcher analyzed the tapes and drafted a 4,000-word biography. This final validation interview was also a time for the two participants to discuss more fully their experiences as participants in the pilot study. Embedded in these reflections are technical and ethical issues related to life-story interviewing. Selected aspects of experiences in six initial interviews, supplemented by tapes, field notes, journal entries, a biography, and recollections, are the focus of the inquiry. (TJH)",

This supplement was designed to collect data concerning the methodology associated with the receipt of postsecondary financial aid within the first 4 years after high school for selected members of the HSB senior and sophomore cohorts. Financial aid data were collected for students in the sophomore cohort (n=10,026) during 1986-87 for the 1982-83 through 1985-86 academic years. Senior cohort (n=10,708) data were collected for the 1980-81 through 1983-84 school years. Sources of data include federal records of the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, federal records of the Pell Grant Program, and  yearly GSL disbursement data from guarantee agencies participating in the GSL program. In addition, for students in the senior cohort, financial aid data were collected from the postsecondary institutions that the students reported attending. Original and follow-up data collection techniques, which depended on mail and telephone contacts and extraction of data from data bases, are described; and software and data entry and editing are discussed. Administration of the Institution Financial Aid Records Survey to the senior cohort is discussed; and the methods used to extract data from the records of the state guarantee agency GSL program, the federal guaranteed student loan program, and the Pell Grant disbursement program are described. Problems associated with confidentiality and  non-response are also covered. Seven data tables, three figures, and eight exhibits are presented.

Areas covered include reading, writing, mathematics, science, American history, literature, and computer competence. Trends in academic achievement, levels of learning, and factors related to achievement are discussed. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has conducted regular surveys of student proficiency in a range of subjects, each involving a national sample of students; about 1.4 million students from a cross-section of grade levels have participated in the assessments to date. Findings from recent NAEP assessments provide evidence of progress  in students' academic achievement. Results from the 1984 and 1986 assessments indicate that, on the average, students' proficiency in reading has improved; proficiency in writing, mathematics, and science has improved in recent assessments following earlier declines. Equity is being approached between minority students and their white peers. Student achievement gains are associated with time spent on homework, course rigor, participatory teaching, and supportive home environments. The findings also indicate a lack of significant advancement in the area of innovative and thoughtful application of knowledge. Descriptions of proficiency levels (levels 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350) for reading, mathematics, and science are appended in the form of sample test items. (TJH)",

Thus, of 2.9 million 11th graders questioned in 1986, an estimated 1.6 million were employed and attending school. Data in this report cover the general characteristics and academic achievement of working students included in the NAEP as well as ancillary information from other studies. Student characteristics analyzed include gender, race/ethnicity, parents' education, high school program type, mathematics and science courses taken, postsecondary  expectations, absenteeism, homework time, and television viewing time. Results indicate that: (1) employment has various effects on student achievement; (2) schools vary in the amount of time and effort they demand from their students, but it appears that some teachers lower their expectations regarding working students; (3) students' jobs should be examined in terms of content compatible with youth development and achievement; and (4) where work assignments are connected to schooling objectives, work can complement, rather than compete with, schooling objectives. Twenty-nine data tables and one graph are included. (TJH)",

The developmental methodology is introduced, and the first steps in the process are reported. A historical review traces the advances made in the field and the formal systems developed for reviewing test items. A Computer Aided Item Construction Project has been initiated to integrate the results of test writing research into an Authoring System for Item Construction (ASIC) program. An existing systems development method was used to guide the process of developing the authoring system. This method, Information Systems Work and Analysis of Changes (ISAC), starts with analyzing the needs, ideas,  and problems of those who handle information. Only this first stage, Change Analysis, is described in this report. Steps in change analysis are: (1) problem analysis; (2) description of the existing situation; (3) making a test plan; (4) choosing an item format; (5) creating the test item; (6) checking the items; (7) study of change alternatives; (8) developing a blueprint; (9) choice of the item format; (10) generating items; and (11) checking items. Problems of item writing are described and listed in two tables with reference to whether an authoring system would contribute to their solution and the validity of the test.

It is shown that expected item information in the unconditional model equals information in the marginal model, provided the assumption of sampling examinees from an ability distribution is made. For the logistic ability distribution considered in this paper, item information in the two models can be expressed in a closed form. Also, it is shown that for a random examinee expected item information in the conditional model is always less than that in the other two models, albeit the difference quickly decreases with an increase in test length. If the distribution of the item difficulties in the test deviates more and more from the  ability distribution, item information in all three models takes smaller and smaller values. Results from a simulation study of tests with 5 and 20 items demonstrate these features numerically. Six tables present the results of the simulation study, and one graph illustrates item information in the marginal model. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Many multidimensional item response theory (IRT) models have been proposed. A comparison is made between the so-called full information models and the models that use only pairwise information. Three multidimensional models described are: (1) the compensatory model of R. D. Bock and M. Aitken (1981) using the computer program TESTFACT; (2) a model based on R. P. McDonald's (1985) harmonic analysis using the program NOHARM; and (3) the computer program MAXLOG of R. L. McKinley and M. D. Reckase (1983). Five factor analysis procedures for dichotomous items are discussed. A simulation study was conducted to compare the various methods. The item parameters of four different sets of items were used with numbers of subjects set at 250, 500, and 1,000. Ten replications were generated  for each set of item parameters and each sample size. All models were compared with respect to estimates of IRT and factor analysis parameters using six criteria in terms of mean squared differences between the known and estimated item parameters. The most striking result of the simulation study was that common factor analysis programs outperformed the more complex programs TESTFACT, MAXLOG, and NOHARM. It was apparent that a common factor analysis in the matrix of tetrachoric correlations yielded the best estimates. A procedure based on the mean squared residuals of the correlation matrix was also presented for assessing the dimensionality of the model. Nine tables present the data from the simulation study.

For the Rasch model, it is proved that: (1) the joint distribution of subtest-residuals (the components of the index) is asymptotically multivariate normal; and (2) the distribution of the index is asymptotically chi-square. The parameters of these asymptotic distributions depend on whether ability of a person is known or estimated. Furthermore, the rate of convergence to the asymptotic distribution of the subtest-residuals is analyzed. In order to verify the results for short tests, a simulation study was conducted.

Both models have a linear form and can be solved by using a branch-and-bound algorithm. The first model assumes an item bank calibrated under the Rasch model and can be used, for instance, when classical test theory has to serve as an interface between the item bank system and a user not familiar with modern test theory. Maximization of alpha was obtained by inserting a special constraint in a linear programming model. The second model has wider applicability and can be used with any item bank for which estimates of the classical item parameter are available. The models can be expanded to meet practical constraints with respect to test composition. An empirical study with  simulated data using two item banks of 500 items was carried out to evaluate the model assumptions. For Item Bank 1 the underlying response was the Rasch model, and for Item Bank 2 the underlying model was the three-parameter model.

In  some applications, combinations of the basic types of decisions may occur. Samples of decision problems illustrate the optimization of the Bayes utility for each possible decision.

The first discussion, &quot;Test Design as Model Building in Mathematical Programming&quot; (T. J. J. M. Theunissen), presents test design as a decision process under certainty. A natural way of modeling this process leads to mathematical programming. General models of test construction are discussed, with information about algorithms and heuristics; ideas about the analysis and refinement of test constraints are also considered. The second paper, &quot;Methods for Simultaneous Test Construction&quot; (Ellen Boekkooi-Timminga), gives an overview of simultaneous test construction using zero-one programming. The item selection process is based on IRT. Some objective functions and practical constraints are  presented, the construction of parallel tests is considered, and two tables are provided. The third paper, &quot;Automated Test Construction Using Minimax Programming&quot; (Wim J. van der Linden), proposes the use of the minimax principle in IRT test construction and indicates how this results in test information functions deviating less systematically from the target function than for the usual criterion of minimal test length. An alternative approach and some practical constraints are considered. The final paper, &quot;A Procedure To Assess Target Information Functions&quot; (Henk Kelderman), discusses the concept of an information function and its properties. An interpretable function of information is chosen: the probability of a wrong order of the ability estimates of two subjects. (SLD)",

Both algorithms are evaluated through a simulation study with generated data. Item parameters are given for four generated unidimensional data sets and two generated two-dimensional sets. Abilities were randomly sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with a sample size of 1,000. Results for the top-down algorithm were poor,  but results for the bottom-up algorithm were more encouraging. It is suggested that alternating the bottom-up algorithm with one or two iterations of the top-down algorithm would allow the procedure to reject items that were added incorrectly in a previous step.

        "description":"This document presents oral and written testimony concerning the effectiveness of federal assistance programs in reducing infant mortality. In opening statements, members of the House Select Committee on Hunger voiced their concern over the persistence of high infant death rates among minorities, the rural poor, and urban populations, despite national declines. The positive effect of such governmental interventions as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) was acknowledged to be limited due to insufficient federal funding. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), outlined CDF recommendations to ensure access to WIC, Medicaid, and other federal assistance programs for all who qualify for these benefits. Linda A.  Randolph, director of the New York State Office of Public Health, described New York initiatives to combat infant mortality and low birth weight, but admitted that many needs remain unmet. J. Michael McGinnis of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that progress against infant mortality is slowing and that many infant health goals for the 1980s are unlikely to be achieved. Paul H. Wise of Harvard Medical School stated his view that progress in infant survival is entering a phase of increased vulnerability, calling for renewed nutrition programs for women and infants. The text of additional prepared statements and participant questions and answers are also included. (AF)",

        "description":"The oral testimony and prepared statements of educational researchers and practitioners comprise this record of a hearing on the proposed national research and development center for the effective education of disadvantaged youth. Committee members expressed concern about Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) accountability in funding and review processes for the proposed center. The failure of OERI administrators to testify was noted. The idea of &quot;learning grant colleges,&quot; based on the agricultural extension programs of land grant institutions, was forwarded as a delivery system for research, development, and dissemination. Testimony suggested that the plan for the proposed center reflected too little commitment to the educational needs of  the disadvantaged and too little input from advocates and knowledgeable persons. Argument was made for distribution of funding among existing centers, and systemic responses to developmental needs of the disadvantaged. Commitment to the premise that all children can learn was advanced as a critical step in the process. The following issues were seen to require careful consideration: (1) student role ascription; (2) collaboration; (3) governance; (4) grant awarding; (5) funding; (6) dissemination; and (7) systematic equity. A key role for educational technology in disadvantaged education was urged. Increased academic involvement and decreased partisan interference in education were recommended. (AF)",

        "description":"This report attempts to identify and analyze the causes of the differences between the earnings and employment of black males and white males. Although the earnings gap between black and white men was substantially reduced between 1940 and 1980, black men still earn less than white men. While the relative earnings of black men has risen since 1940, their relative employment has declined. Factors that influence the earnings gap include the following: (1) discrimination; (2) education; (3) region of residence; (4) industrial sector; and (5) marital status. The report finds that while a narrowing of racial differences in worker characteristics accounts for part of the earnings convergence, other factors, including declining racial prejudice, federal civil rights policies, and  unmeasured changes in employment skills, must be considered. The precise effect of civil rights policy remains undetermined. Some of the evidence attributes earnings differentials to differences in knowledge and skills acquired in school. Further research on the following issues is recommended: (1) the effect of civil rights programs; (2) black-white differentials in educational attainment; (3) declining labor force participation among younger black men; (4) upward earnings bias due to labor force withdrawal; and (5) the failure of the black-white unemployment gap to narrow. The report includes four appendices, a bibliography, 51 statistical tables, and nine figures. (AF)",

The study separately examines the economic status of the following six largest Asian groups in America: (1) Chinese; (2) Filipinos; (3) Japanese; (4) Asian Indians; (5) Koreans; and (6) Vietnamese. Separate consideration is given to native-born and immigrant populations. Patterns in Asian immigration to the United States and trends in the skill composition of immigrants are traced for the years 1850 through 1980. Current population characteristics of the Asian American family are explored. The study reports on family economic status, including average earnings and the effect of number  of contributors to family income. Factors influencing skill differentials, including educational attainment, work experience, and English-language proficiency, are studied. Analyses of earnings and employment for Asian men are presented, as well as studies of Asian women in the work force. A statistical approach is used to test for evidence of labor market discrimination against Asians. Changes in Asians' relative economic status between 1960 and 1980 are described, and recommendations for future research and data collection are forwarded.

At the heart of the problem is the inner-city community of adults that has been decimated, leaving few who are capable of responding to the need or bringing meaning and guidance to young people's lives. Because the political will does not exist to eradicate poverty through welfare state strategies, educators must develop schools that can overcome polarization along racial, social, and cultural lines. Inner-city institutions must be rebuilt through schooling in order to sustain democracy and nurture independence and self-reliance. Community schools are the perfect mechanism to prepare workers for the more democratic  marketplace needed to enhance national productivity and competitiveness. While schools may be the focus of the revitalization effort, policies that address housing, health, income, child care, and economic development are essential to transforming central cities. The following incentives and opportunities are needed for the development of a new school-community relationship: (1) waive regulations and policies that impede the development of community schools; (2) increase incentive funding; and (3) empower schools to create curricula and environments appropriate to local needs in exchange for the schools' accountability for educational outcomes.

        "description":"Educational reform movements aimed at providing equal opportunities for minority children have ignored the basic social, political, and economic context in which schooling takes place. Although equal educational opportunity has emerged as the central ideology of American schooling, underlying characteristics of American society prevent these ideals from being achieved. American society is fundamentally unequal and this inequality is perpetuated by limiting the access of subordinate groups to political, economic, and social power. The content and structure of schooling is not neutral, but actively reproduces this societal inequality through the knowledge and cultural mode which has been designated as a high status and through mechanisms by which groups are sorted and treated  differentially. Schools are part of the larger societal dynamic which functions to perpetuate structural and cultural inequality, and school reform movements should be viewed, in part, as a reflection of dominant cultural beliefs. The following traditional assumptions about the role of schools in society are analyzed: (1) meritocracy; (2) upward mobility; (3) the myth of the \"Model Minority\"; and (4) functionalism. (FMW)",

        "description":"This report simultaneously examines alternative mobility decisions and changes in the demographic determinants of residential mobility over the period 1940-80. Alternative mobility decisions are defined as the choice to move locally, to migrate within a state, or to migrate between states. Determinants of mobility include age, race, sex, and educational attainment. A polychotomous multivariate model of mobility was used to analyze data drawn from the public use microdata samples (PUMS) of the decennial censuses of 1940, 1960, 1970, and 1980. Conclusions include the following: (1) educational attainment promotes migration, but not local mobility; (2) the influence of education declines with age up to age 30; (3) blacks are less mobile and migratory than the rest of the population;  (4) there is no discernible time trend in racial differentials; (5) females are slightly more locally mobile than males and less migratory with no apparent time trend; and (6) home ownership has a stronger limiting effect on migration than on local mobility. Statistical data are included on five tables. A list of 42 references and three tables of statistical data on geographic mobility by age, education, and race are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This paper examines the growing college premium for younger men and the earnings patterns for other groups that developed between 1973 and 1987. At first glance, the rapidly increasing college premium for young men seems to confirm several frequently cited economic trends, including a massive restructuring of the economy that displaces all less educated workers into low-paying jobs and the devaluation of a high school diploma due to the deterioration of public education. However, a review of earning trends for all groups of workers suggests the influence of the following forces on wage trends: (1) shifts in the demand for different kinds of labor; (2) shifts in the supply of different kinds of labor; and (3) macroeconomic forces which determine the underlying trend in wage  growth. The economic stagnation of the 1973-1987 period explains the slow growth of all earnings. However, most movements in relative earnings were not driven by changes in the supply of different kinds of labor. The earnings of older men and women performed better than those of younger workers because and demand for younger workers decreased during periods of adjustment in manufacturing employment. Much of the continued slow growth in wages reflects the sustained low growth in productivity which reflects our ability to educate workers. Statistical data are included on six graphs and eight tables. The appendices comprise discussions of the effects of alternative price deflators on real income and testing for the significance of earnings differences. (FMW)",

Views on this issue were sought from young corporate and community leaders.

Evidence and arguments are presented to begin the development of a national strategy for this population. The chapters are the following: (1) \"Early Childhood Programs for Children in Poverty: A Good Place to Start\" (Bernice Weissbourd, Carol Emig); (2) \"Early Intervention in Cognitive Development As a Strategy for Reducing Poverty\" (James Garbarino); (3) \"Our Nation's Youngest Children: Who They Are and How They Are Cared  For\" (Eleanor S.

        "description":"The subject of this report is the impact of microelectronic technology on the process of skill formation with particular reference to two industries: banking and textiles. A recent research effort sought to identify and understand how changes in the structure and nature of skills were affecting the process of skill formation and the balance of training and preparatory responsibilities between firms and the education system. Findings indicated that the relationship between new technology and flexible production was ambiguous. In textiles, modernization was underway before the industry started its current efforts to promote flexibility and quick response. In banking, microelectronics was a crucial factor in the explosion of products and services available from financial  institutions. In textiles, skilled jobs required more training and higher skills. In banking, the reduction of low-level, unskilled jobs was still more striking. When the organization of production was changed, in both industries, lower-level workers had to have an aptitude for a broader set of tasks and a more abstract understanding of their jobs. Banks have reduced their long-term commitment to workers and have cut back on internal promotions. The textile industry is also having problems with internal promotion because its unskilled work force cannot acquire additional skills through informal on-the-job training. (YLB)",

The strongest trend in the results of these studies was the importance that employers placed on employee attitudes. A second theme was the emphasis on basic skills as opposed to job-specific skills. Employers were particularly interested in communication and problem-solving skills. Two general weaknesses were apparent in the studies that should be addressed in further studies of employer needs: (1) the studies lacked a clear conceptual basis for asking about employee characteristics; and (2) sampling strategies were typically developed with more attention to the convenience of the investigation and less to the  representativeness of individual respondents. One study detailed four perspectives that may explain the hiring decisions of employers: technical, control, institutional, and political. (A list of 24 references is included.) (YLB)",

Subjects were 100 black and white men and women in the upper middle class of the professional class in business, academia, or government. All were midcareer, aged 40-55. Sixty came from disadvantaged backgrounds; the others formed a control group of people with at least one parent who graduated from high school or held higher status jobs. Findings indicated educational attainment was crucial. In addition, a positive relationship with a teacher was an important factor. Religion in the home was able to offset difficulties, and some achievers applied the positive aspects of religion to their professional development. Mentoring was  shown to be an important factor in success; however, this was heavily influenced by both gender and race. One crucial personality trait was a willingness to work hard. Also important was the ability to confront problems directly and to turn them into positive experiences. Finally, a belief in one's ability to succeed was a vital prerequisite. (YLB)",

A study by the U.S. Department of Labor and the American Society for Training and Development shows that employers want workers with skills in many areas--not just skills in reading, writing, and computation. Successful programs use the practices often recommended when teaching adults, including clearly defining objectives, using materials relevant to the students' needs, giving frequent feedback, and using  evaluation to improve program effectiveness. Successful programs include a needs assessment and a literacy audit. The curriculum should be organized by job tasks, be built on employees' knowledge of the job content, give employees an opportunity to work together and learn from each other, and link the goals of the company and participating employees. Guidelines for development of work-related curriculum materials are found in \"Functional Context Education: Workshop Resource Notebook\" (Sticht, 1987) and \"The Handbook for Trade-Related Curriculum Development\" (Felton, 1981). Pretesting and posttesting of actual job tasks and interviews with employees and supervisors should be used. Appendix A contains a five-step process for performing a literacy audit. Appendix B contains: (1) a  comprehensive chart providing information about four different types of evaluation; and (2) some prototype evaluation forms used by the Massachusetts Workplace Initiative programs.

The major conclusion was that in the long run privatization is most successful in localities that have protected the jobs of employees with &quot;no lay-off agreements&quot; or &quot;right of first refusal&quot; requirements. The purposive sample of localities studied was selected from lists compiled by such groups as the International City Management Association and the Privatization Council.

The KSAs were identified and compiled into a master list, then grouped into categories. Categories included self-education, basic academic (functional literacy), oral communication,  adaptability, personal management, group effectiveness, and influence. The validation panel revised the list, combining the &quot;self-education&quot; and &quot;personal management&quot; categories and focusing the statements on practice concepts.

        "description":"The resurgence of national interest in youth service is due, in large part, to the national organizations that have grown so vigorously in recent years. Some explanations for the almost sudden reappearance of youth service as a nationwide issue are: (1) many Americans are fed up with narcissism, personal gratification, and me-centered pursuits; (2) Americans have discovered that they are no longer number one in the world; (3) the nation's leaders in industry, government, and the media have faced the potentially disastrous shortage of productive young people; (4) children and youth suffer from deficits in learning skills and self-esteem; and (5) a growing body of research shows again that education should include both schooling and experience. Along with the growing interest in  and popularity of youth service go a number of pitfalls of which leaders in the youth service movement need to be aware. Service should not be seen as a way of &quot;privatizing&quot; the financing and provision of major public services. Service is not cost free but requires the outlay of additional dollars even though it creates tax savings and public savings. Service programs must be quality programs. Youth service must become an integral part of the formal education process. Finally, service should not be viewed as little more than another form of philanthropy or social responsibility. Every young person is a potential contributor. (YLB)",

        "description":"The Pennsylvania Summer Youth Service Corps (SYSC) is an effort to assimilate the ideals of community service exemplified by the Peace Corps, VISTA, and the Civilian Conservation Corps with the long-established Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP). SYSC differs from the existing summer youth employment program by its focus and orientation on service contributions to one's community, state, and nation, not simply on earning money in a summer job; teams of young people working with a full-time crew leader; work assignments that are visible projects providing lasting benefits to the community; and learning goals that are focused on self-development, increased competence, and improved self-esteem. Designated service delivery areas under the auspices of the Job  Training Partnership Act (JTPA) administer SYSC. Once selected, corpsmembers participate in a &quot;wilderness challenge&quot; experience designed to develop leadership, self-confidence, trust, and teamwork. The following week, work crews begin their assigned work project; educational services are integrated into the daily activities of each work crew. A task force formed to explore ways to improve the SYETP has conducted workshops to provide information on SYSC and to train corps crew leaders. SYSC uses existing federal, state, and local resources for its support; the majority of funds comes from JTPA. Pennsylvania plans to expand SYSC in 1990. (YLB)",

Part 1 analyzes the general technological and educational infrastructure in Yugoslavia. The sources of technology as well as the present state and future prospects of technological research are described. Education is discussed in terms of its response to technological change. Part 2 contains five case studies of firms that were developing or introducing new technology on a considerable scale. Each study is presented in two sections. In the first, problems and findings are given. In the second, conclusions are reached and certain International Labour Office hypotheses are tested. Part 3 presents generalizations based on the case studies, including the following: firms  greatly affected by technological change have a good production and marketing record; personnel skills and abilities influence strongly the successful introduction of new technology; the government does not actively support innovation; the current economic situation hinders expansion and development of the educational system; industry plays a strong role in determining educational curricula and in the enrollment policies of universities; and the companies have good connections with foreign firms for cooperation, acquisition of technology, technical backup, and some training.

The study examined the extent to which CBVA training content was used in the organization and delivery of assessment services to students with handicaps at the training sites. Four inservice and six preservice sites were included in the study; 28 vocational and special education personnel were interviewed and observed during onsite visits and by telephone. An analysis of within and across-site data revealed a pattern of increasingly comprehensive outcome levels at the sites. Findings also included the identification of key implementation variables. Three site features--the role of the system  advocate, the role of the external supporters, and the nature of the work environment--appeared to be directly related to the level of training outcomes. A fourth, continued training, was found to affect implementation most markedly. A set of guidelines for training and implementation was also identified. Major recommendations included an incremental approach to training and use of a site assessment for the selection of training sites and implementation strategies.

It offers rehabilitation facilities and other programs a practical book on how to provide long-term follow-up services in a variety of settings and using a variety of models. Section I is a limited review of current literature on transition employment and supported work in general and on providing follow-up services in particular. Chapters 1 and 2 define and describe the train-place and place-train models for providing rehabilitation services and variations of the place-train model. Chapter 3 deals with assessment of the worker before and during placement and training processes. Chapter 4 presents reasons why long-term follow-up services are a vital component of supported employment programs. Chapter 5  offers specific methods and procedures to increase the effectiveness of follow-up services. Section II describes four programs offering integrated follow-up services. They illustrate exemplary work programs within different settings: supported work services to persons who are mentally retarded in an urban setting, to persons who are mentally ill in an urban setting, and in a small rural facility serving mainly developmentally disabled persons and transition programs within a community college serving small city and rural areas.

        "description":"The field of cognitive science (as represented, for instance, by intergenerational literacy programs) offers new ways to think about increasing cognitive abilities, which is particularly important in view of the disappointing outcomes of many intervention programs that do not seem to make their participants more knowledgeable or better thinkers. Important to cognitive scientists are the beliefs that (1) development of cognitive ability continues throughout life; (2) the processes involved in cognition are as important as the end product or behavior; (3) knowledge and the processes used to operate on knowledge are inseparable so that abilities must be developed within the context of the types of situations and tasks to which one expects the knowledge to be applied; and (4) the  individual's potential for intellectual growth and development is primarily determined by the social and cultural groups into which the person is born and raised. It should be possible almost to double the improvement of cognitive ability that present dollars accomplish. To do so, investment must be made in programs that focus on the intergenerational transfer of cognitive ability; the functional contexts of education; and the linking of problems, practice, and research over extended time.

The report first lists a set of goals and related objectives, and these are followed by two sections discussing (1) technology and the state of the world economy in 1989 and (2) the South and the state of technology. A rationale for the strategic plan is then presented that is intended as a framework for action to spur growth by advancing technology. The plan's six broad goals are then described in detail. They are: (1) technically proficient new entrants in the labor market; (2) upgraded skills in the current work force; (3) improvement and expansion of  research and development; (4) rapid commercialization of new ideas and new technologies; (5) widespread deployment and effective utilization of technology; and (6) integration of science and technology into state policy. Each goal has objectives essential to attaining that goal, and, under each objective, the plan enumerates specific actions that might be taken and by whom to help attain the objective. A discussion of the roles and responsibilities of various actors in the regional economy in bringing about change is provided next, followed by a chart that indicates lead actors for implementation of the objectives.

The data were collected in 1987 as part of a larger study of postsecondary institutions involving survey responses from a nationally representative sample of 432 postsecondary education institutions. Respondents were institutional administrators, college placement directors, academic department chairpersons from occupational areas, faculty, and students in occupational education. The study's major findings are that less than 15 percent of the  student enrollment of a national sample of three types of postsecondary institutions are involved in the program, less than half of those who do participate in the program receive academic credit for that participation, fewer than half of the nation's postsecondary placement directors regard postsecondary education cooperative education as an effective job development strategy, employers have little or no involvement in the determination of grades for participants, and the program is administered through only a small number of faculty coordinators.

(Cogeneration technology would convert raw culm, a byproduct of anthracite coal mining, into a fuel source for steam power generation.) After plant tours and interviews with plant personnel and educational institutions' staff, the study found that staff at a cogeneration plant require professional, craft, and technical knowledge. The professional knowledge is acquired either through a four-year degree program in a relevant discipline or a two-year associate degree program. Craft knowledge, acquired through vocational-technical programs or union training programs, is defined by skills and competencies unique to  fabrication as well as system and facility maintenance and repair. Two kinds of technical knowledge are needed: (1) job-specific knowledge related to operational procedures, system parts and purposes, and troubleshooting procedures, all of which is currently provided to operational crews by a specialized start-up team composed of workers who are experts; and (2) generalizable knowledge of applications and theory that supports use of plant technology, including operational theories, systems design, technical and scientific processes, technical interface, and casualty issues involved with plant operation.

The needs assessment process involved use of the Hersey and Blanchard Changing Skills Model. Typical job descriptions were analyzed, interviews were conducted, and the Nominal Group Technique was used. Twelve employees from the upper ranks of both career ladders participated. Major findings were the following: (1) the size and complexity of the technician career ladders made use  of the standard form of the Nominal Group Technique unsatisfactory; (2) participants were often not knowledgeable about the requirements for positions on the technician career ladder that was not their own; and (3) the Hersey and Blanchard model could not be applied because of the varied levels of technical and human skills needed on the nonmanagement ladder. Consequently, some features of the Delphi Technique were incorporated into the Nominal Group Technique and participants generated and ranked the skills needs for only their own ladder. An extension to the Hersey and Blanchard model was proposed. (The document includes a 34-item bibliography.) (CML)",

Perkins Vocational Education Act, this report discusses three proposals that would establish standards of performance for vocational education and analyzes experiences from performance standards implemented as part of other social and educational programs, such as the Job Training Partnership Act, Chapter 1, minimum competency testing, and merit pay for teachers. The proposals examined are those contained in H.R. 7 (passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May 1989), those from the U.S. Department of Education (introduced as H.R. 2329 and S. 1133), and those from the National Assessment of Vocational Education. A section on the goals of performance standards offers a rationale for such standards.  A comparison of the three proposals shows that they differ on whether or not they would link program decisions and funding to standards: H.R. 7 would not; the proposal from the Department of Education would; and the proposal from the National Assessment of Vocational Education recommends linkage for postsecondary but not for directly secondary vocational education. Another section provides the states' records on adopting performance standards and gives details of the approaches taken by Missouri and Florida. The document also discusses potential problems from performance standards, issues that result from the nature of vocational education, critical decisions, and possible alternatives to performance standards.

The purpose of the application was to reduce the number of unnecessary civilian complaints accumulated by police officers. The project passed through the five phases of ISD: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. During the analysis phase, an instructional need was perceived for a job-specific communications strategy that would transfer easily to learners and that they would choose to use on the job. The design phase resulted in a 4-hour workshop. The development of the project followed a module-by-module approach. A participant workbook was produced, along with a videotape of real police situations where problems  resulted from the inability to use effective communication skills. Eight workshops were delivered. Data on learner reaction and learner acquisition of skills were collected during each workshop. The formative evaluation process included one-on-one trials using the &quot;think aloud&quot; protocol, small-group trials, and field trials. A summative evaluation was conducted. Findings indicated 90 percent of learners rated the workshop very good or outstanding, 75 percent used the skills effectively, and participants had a lower level of civilian complaints.

        "description":"This summary offers highlights of a conference hosted by the Southern Regional Educational Board-State Vocational Education Consortium, a 6-year effort to develop, apply, evaluate, and promote strategies to strengthen the basic competencies of high school students enrolled in vocational education programs. An introduction provides summaries of presentations on the conference goals of sharing information and ideas and combining vocational and academic studies; instructional principles for increased learning; conditions forcing change in the educational system; changing school experiences to improve achievement in the basic competencies; leadership as the key to success; and the need for a better-educated work force. Chapter 1 summarizes participants' comments on the first step  toward improving the preparation of vocational students for employment and continued learning on the job or at a postsecondary institution--raising expectations for students pursuing vocational studies. Chapter 2 focuses on participant remarks concerning the consortium goal of increasing the percentage of vocational students who complete higher-level academic courses. Chapter 3 focuses on workshop presentations that address emphasis on increased academic content in vocational courses and applied learning activities in academic courses. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 summarize participants' comments on pilot site programs that: advance basic competencies through career guidance and remedial studies; provide staff development for vocational and nonvocational teachers; and participate in an evaluation  and assessment plan. A final section is a summary of the conference. (YLB)",

        "description":"Previous research has indicated that locus of control acts to moderate the effects of stressful events. In this study the role of depressive attributions, negative outcome expectancies, and internal locus of control and their interactions with minor negative events in predicting symptoms of psychological distress were examined. Subjects (N=131) were college students; a short-term longitudinal design was used. Results indicated that depressive attributions and moderately internal (rather than extremely internal) locus of control expectancies acted to buffer the effects of minor negative events. In addition, evidence was not supportive of the confluence hypothesis although the finding that expectancies of negative outcomes were related to symptoms is consistent with both the  confluence hypothesis and the learned helplessness model of depression. Results indicated that, in this sample, vulnerability to stress was reduced for individuals with moderately low expectancies of control in combination with depressive attributions for past events. Although these cognitions (depressive attributions, and lower internal control expectancies) may be effective in coping with daily hassles, they may increase the risk of clinical depression if major life events, rather than daily hassles, are encountered.

Included in research literature are descriptive accounts, as well as those focusing on characteristics of the program, student evaluation of field programs, or those assessing the program's influence on students. This study pre- and post-tested placement and comparison groups on four themes that were obtained from a factor analysis of the Skills Checklist of Placement Experience (SCOPE). The themes were client testing, therapeutic interaction, reporting and writing, and non-therapeutic interaction. Students (N=77) were upper class psychology majors attending universities having dissimilar undergraduate populations. Analysis of covariance revealed significant  differences between placement and comparison groups on the first three activity themes. Findings support the arguments of field placement advocates who claim that placement experiences can enhance learning by emphasizing both thinking and doing. Results also support SCOPE's utility for assessing placement settings at different institutions. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"At the middle school level, school climate, curriculum, instructional strategies, and the availability of positive adult role models all affect student performance. This study sought to determine student perceptions of discipline effectiveness, teaching strategies, and school climate. Early adolescents (N=220) between the ages of 11 and 16 in 20 middle schools were interviewed. The schools were representative of large, urban, suburban, and rural settings. Results showed a more positive picture of student perceptions of their schools than might have been expected. When asked to describe their schools, 53 percent gave positive comments, 36 percent gave negative comments, and 11 percent gave noncommital comments. Every student mentioned at least once that they would like someone to  listen to them. For the most part the students who were interviewed were gregarious and talkative and needed more time to socialize than the school day allowed. Fourteen recommendations are given for middle school administrators to use in developing programs for students who cause repeated classroom disturbances and are at risk of alienating themselves from the schooling process. These recommendations range from designing an active advisory program and comprehensive curriculum to helping teachers plan for effective instruction. (ABL)",

The questions on AIDS education examine who the contact person is who is responsible for developing the AIDS policy; the date of the most recent AIDS policy; the branch of state government responsible for administering and enforcing AIDS education and the type of enforcement which the state requires; which curriculum the state asks local school districts to use in AIDS education; and how AIDS education should be integrated into the  regular school schedule. The questions on policies on AIDS carriers in the schools include: (1) contact person; (2) date of the policy; (3) branch of state government responsible for enforcement of the policy; (4) state's policy on forced or voluntary testing; (5) policies which may affect school employees who carry the AIDS virus; (6) state's policy on the requirements for expelling AIDS carriers from the classroom; and (7) degree of confidentiality due the AIDS carriers.

This study examined the quality of experiences adult daughters (N=308) have in their current relationships with their mothers and fathers and the effects of the quality of these relationships on the daughter's psychological well-being/distress. The sample of daughters was drawn from a larger, disproportionate, random, stratified sample of women ages 25 to 55, who were employed as social workers or licensed practical nurses, and who resided within a 25-mile radius of Boston. Quality of experience in the daughter role was assessed separately for the daughter-mother and daughter-father roles. Overall, daughters reported positive experiences with each parent. Having a positive relationship  with one's parent(s) was associated with daughters' reports of high well-being. Having a poor relationship with one's mother was associated with reports of psychological distress, particularly among daughters who were not themselves married/partnered. Having a poor relationship with one's father was also associated with psychological distress, especially among daughters whose fathers were widowed. Race and social class variables were examined for their main and interactive effects on psychological well-being/distress. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"A joint project of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School District, Project DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) is designed to equip elementary and junior high school children with the skills for resisting peer pressure to experiment with drugs and alcohol. The goal is to teach students how to say \"no.\" A growing consensus among experts in education and medicine holds that substance abuse prevention must begin early, well before children have been led by their peers to experiment with drugs and alcohol. Most important, Project DARE introduces this training just at the time when the peer pressure begins. DARE's instructors are Los Angeles police officers on full-time duty with the project. Assigned to five schools per semester, the officers visit  classrooms once a week to present an innovative curriculum developed by school district personnel. Veteran police officers with several years of street experience, the DARE instructors have a credibility unmatched by regular classroom teachers. Through the DARE lessons, students learn that: real friends will not push them into trying drugs and alcohol; the majority of their peers do not use these substances; being grown up means making their own decisions and coping with problems in a positive way; and they can assert themselves in the face of peer pressure. The DARE curriculum is organized into 17 classroom sessions in which a wide range of teaching activities are used that are designed to encourage student participation and response. (ABL)",

In the workplace, adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) have recently become acknowledged as a group who face special challenges. The purposes of this study were to deepen the understanding of the issues that ACOAs face in the workplace; to test the efficacy of action science as a theory and method of intervention; and to examine the incidental and reflective learning practices of the interventionist as well as of the group participants. This study examined the incidental learning processes of a group of professionals who were self-identified ACOAs. Subjects were six  self-identified adult children who met weekly with a facilitator (an adult child of an alcoholic herself) for 16 weeks. For the facilitator, much of her learning revolved around how to make judgment calls in situations which brought to the surface both therapeutic and educational issues. For the group, much of the experience involved learning from other's blind spots, the value of surrendering control of the learning process, and group empowerment. (Author/ABL)",

These include: (1) how are physicians using social support in an effective manner; (2) what are the most effective ways for physicians and their office staff to involve social support network members and significant others in patients' care; (3) what is the most effective way to teach physicians how to involve others in patients' treatment; (4) which patients will desire and benefit from their families' involvement and which patients won't; and (5) how can physicians economically identify the differences between these two groups. Applied research is needed in this area. It is important to  investigate the mechanisms of action through which social support and compliance are correlated. Social comparison theory is important in this area. Another theoretical application is the use of &quot;vicarious observation&quot; by significant others, as has been done with cardiac rehabilitation patients. A major assumption which researchers in the field of social support should not take for granted is that it is easier to modify social support than to reduce stress. (ABL)",

A year-long study of the school histories of 219 secondary students suspended numerous times from the Montgomery County Public Schools examined these students' early school experiences and behavior. Only two percent of students in grades 7-12 were suspended numerous times. Multiple suspendees differed noticeably from nonsuspendees or students suspended only once. Some of the areas of differences included participation in extracurricular activities, placement in special education programs, course grades, and school attendance. The five suspendee types identified are: fighter, student-in-crisis, truant, low achiever, and episodic. Data supported the contention that except  for the episodic suspendee, predicting who will become a suspendee is possible. Different levels of success with correcting the misbehavior of suspendees had been experienced depending on the suspendee type. Late and inappropriate interventions contributed to intervention failure. The study's findings justify differentiating the treatment of students with discipline problems. (ABL)",

A negative correlation was found between alcohol and drug use, religiosity, and a moral self-concept. Findings supported the hypothesis that sexual aggression is part of a larger constellation of antisocial behaviors.

The background of the project came from the Department of Education monograph, &quot;Schools Without Drugs,&quot; which discusses themes such as the danger of drugs, the negative consequences of drugs on the educational process, and the concept of the school as a closed environment in which children could be taught to deal effectively with the drug problem. the project was well received by and promoted collaboration from the funding source and school personnel alike. It matched design requirements that the funding  source had postulated for an effective, comprehensive, drug education approach and avoided detracting political and potentially negative accountability and targeting difficulties associated with other approaches. For school personnel, it promoted local ownership of curriculum, avoided the labeling of drug education as an &quot;add-on,&quot; and enabled personnel to directly address a high priority societal issue in a professional way that did not displace them from their perceived-as-appropriate instructional realms, nor the comfort zones of their accustomed performance in that realm.

In addition to a student questionnaire, a parental and school personnel form was developed to assess the same content areas. The instrument was administered to 5,435 junior and high school students. The incidence of drug and alcohol use was compared to national averages. Use levels of drugs in the rural Northwest were generally below national averages.  Alcohol was reported to be the most used drug, with only 17.3% of high school seniors surveyed reporting that they never used alcohol. Although 83% of the respondents reported never using marijuana, 3% said they used marijuana daily. Although marijuana, tobacco, and hard drug use appeared to be lower than national averages, alcohol use was similar to the national average, with 82.7% of seniors reporting having tried alcohol. Hopefully, the data will be of use for particular districts and communities as they develop specific alcohol and drug education curricula. (ABL)",

        "description":"Numerous reviews and studies have documented high levels of substance use and abuse in the United States when compared to other developed nations. Previous research has identified several factors which place adolescents at risk for substance abuse. This study was designed to replicate and validate some of these risk factors with youth from rural communities. Participants (N=5,435) were students in grades 7-12 from 31 schools in north central Idaho. Information was collected through use of a questionnaire which assessed demographic information, attitudes towards drugs and their usage, perception of community use levels, basic knowledge about drugs, and nine other selected risk factors. These risk factors included alcohol use at an early age, low educational achievement, low  religious commitment, perceived levels of adult and peer drug use, perceived parental and peer approval of drug use, limited educational plans, and reported school attendance. The nine risk factors were found to be significantly related to drug use for the adolescents. Parental failure to communicate strong disapproval of drug usage had the strongest relationship with reported levels of drug usage, closely followed by peer approval as a predictor. As the number of risk factors adolescents possesses increased, they were more likely to report drug use. One potential way for communities to deal with adolescent drug abuse is to reduce the number of risk factors present in their youth. (ABL)",

Value priority differences have been shown to predict important political, social, and economic attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of this study was to identify differences and similarities among the value hierarchies of adolescents who have never tried alcohol, adolescents who tried alcohol a few times, adolescents who used alcohol regularly, and adolescents who were heavy users of alcohol. A large written questionnaire was administered to a sample of 5,435 adolescents from grades 6-12 in the rural inland northwest. The questionnaire assessed reported alcohol usage, selected demographic information, plus terminal and instrumental values with the Rokeach Value Survey. Numerous statistically significant  differences were found in the value hierarchies of adolescents who reported using different levels of alcohol. The priority placed on 15 of 18 terminal values and 11 of 18 instrumental values were statistically significant in differentiating the four groups of adolescents. The results of this study clearly outlined strong value differences among adolescents who abstain from alcohol, those who have experimented, those who are regular users, and those who are heavy users. The more adolescents reported using alcohol the more emphasis they placed on self-centered or personally oriented terminal values and the more emphasis they placed on self-actualizing or competence instrumental values.

Variables were classified as stable if they did not covary with substance use across time. Variables were further classified as risk factors (predictive of initiation), protective factors (predictive of quitting) and/or consequences of past substance use. Data were collected from adolescents (N=651) aged 11 to 15 and their parents who completed  questionnaires in two annual assessments. Parents' attitudes and adolescents perceptions of parents' attitudes were stable characteristics.

        "description":"The continuing trend towards the deinstitutionalization of the psychiatrically disabled population and the treatment of this population from an outpatient or community-based perspective has led to increasing numbers of psychiatrically disabled individuals seeking services in the community. This situation, combined with the growing acknowledgement by mental health and rehabilitation professionals of the importance of vocational or career counseling, makes it inevitable that agencies engaged in vocational counseling will be seeing increasing numbers of these clients. As these clients present symptoms and concerns which are outside of the usual range of expertise of many vocational counselors, difficulties can be anticipated unless the counseling service and the individual  counselors are prepared to deal with this particular population. If the counseling experience is to be beneficial to both counselor and client, then it is essential that the vocational or career counselor be knowledgeable about the issues and difficulties that face the psychiatrically disabled client. There are no hard and fast rules applying to the psychiatrically disabled client. The critical factor remains the willingness of counselor and client to believe that psychiatrically disabled individuals can and should develop the skills to move beyond mere job seeking to participate in more global career planning activities.

After an overview and critique of current approaches to both supply reduction and demand reduction. The study recommends a series of policy initiatives. Demand reduction initiatives include: (1) developing knowledge for more and better prevention techniques; (2) educating people in key roles to deal with drug abuse; and (3)  using the influence of the mass media. Supply reduction initiatives include conducting epidemiological studies in trans-shipment and supplier countries and increasing public awareness and prevention programs in these countries. (TE)",

After an introductory discussion of the research design for Monitoring the Future, the paper presents and discusses a series of demographic tables that show cross-sectional relationships between several forms of drug use and the following characteristics: (1) deviance; (2) propensity for risk  taking; (3) religious commitment; (4) attachment to school; (5) time spent out of the home; (6) healthy lifestyle orientation; and (7) counter culture orientation. The last table is a measure of the cumulative variance explained by lifestyle factors.

The opening remarks by Jerald G.

Thereafter, Lloyd D. Johnston describes current research designs and procedures for the Monitoring the Future project, an annual survey of a representative sample of high school seniors, together with follow-up surveys of a subset of these students up to age 22 noting that the survey covers a wide range of topics and has taken place every year since  1975. He then presents a selection of findings relating to changes in the use of four specific drugs: marijuana, cocaine, cigarettes, and alcohol. Bachman follows with a discussion of patterns of change and stability in post-high school drug use. In particular, he discusses how changes in drug use relate to the new roles and responsibilities of young people after they leave high school. The final part of his talk focuses on how changes in marijuana use are linked to changing perceptions among young people of the risk involved in using it. The presentation includes 30 visual displays, some showing statistical data and trend analysis graphs. (TE)",

Accordingly, this study undertook to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a sample of 196 mothers of 5- and 6-year-old children; to identify sociodemographic correlates of depressive symptoms among these women; and to determine if chronic stress is associated with depressive symptoms independent of other risk factors. In-home interviews were conducted with the participants using the Center for Epidemologic Studies--Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Everyday Stressors Index (ESI). High depressive symptoms were reported by 49 percent of the mothers. Depressive symptoms were highest among mothers who had never married, had less than a high school  education, were under 25 years of age, were black, and had a low income. The ESI was a strong predictor of high depressive symptoms, controlling sociodemographic characteristics. Results suggest the importance of chronic, daily stressors as correlates of depressive symptoms in mothers of young children and also point to the need for multivariate models when examining predictors of depressive symptoms.

Subjects, 22 fourth-graders in a single-grade class, were divided into instructional groups based on chronological age while the instructional grouping for 22 students in a combined fourth and fifth grade class at a neighboring school cut across age and grade levels. The Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills was used to measure the growth in &quot;total reading&quot; over a 1-year period. Results indicated no statistically significant difference between means of the two groups, although a positive mean score in favor of the multi-age instructional design was noted.

In composition studies, the awareness that the intelligent activity of students can produce apparently &quot;incoherent&quot; prose requires appeals for the research community to decide what truly is or is not an error, and to monitor stages of growth in individual basic writers. The new research on error counsels instructors to read students' writing in context, which requires looking beyond a writer's &quot;idiosyncratic grammar&quot; to the broader network of relations between language and power that make basic writers' grammars what they are. To help students see their  struggle with prestige forms of literacy in the context of the social stratification of language and power in American culture, they should read a variety of academic writings on ethnography, language, and literature. Whereas error researchers talk of development in mostly broad terms--replacing an erroneous rule with a conventional use--the ethnographic approach sanctions an interchange between cultures, legitimizing cultural differences by recognizing them as a primary object of study.

The number of papers that editorialized about the nominees was quite high--between 76% and 97%, depending on the nominee.

Coleman's work in Cuba was recognized because of her determination to overcome almost insurmountable opposition by American authorities and many male colleagues who refused to recognize her as a professional and allow her to travel with the troops as most correspondents did. She was pressured to produce  stories from a woman's angle, which meant that her work was seen as marginal. It also appears that her newspaper did not pay her full remuneration for her services. While (like her male colleagues) paying some lip service to American military interests, &quot;Kit&quot; was able to condemn the war from a &quot;female&quot; perspective--expressing concern, for example, for the soldiers on all sides of the conflict. &quot;Kit's&quot; enduring appeal throughout her 25 years as Canada's most successful woman journalist was due to her combination of &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; characteristics--she was outspoken, intellectual, emotional, and maternal.

The study employed a national mail survey of 624 members of the Associated Press Sports Editors in 1988; 249 usable responses were received for a reponse rate of 40 percent. The sports journalists were overwhelmingly white males. Respondents evaluated a scale of 20 professional and non-professional items. Results indicated that: (1) based on a scale of professional items the sports journalists rated themselves higher than their peers who write hard news and soft news;  and (2) on a scale of &quot;nonprofessional&quot; items they generally rated themselves as no different from their colleagues in hard news and soft news.

These metaphors are referred to as Cartesian in order to locate them historically and within a cultural setting. The first type of metaphor serves as a conduit of language, in which ordinary discourse tacitly generates a linear, sender-receiver model for thinking about the nature of human communication. A second is the metaphor of the autonomous individual in which the individual's behavior and characteristics are the primary sources of reason, thought, and moral authority. This metaphor shapes tacit images of scholarship, intelligence, work, and self. The third is a metaphor of technical rationality which identifies  thought and knowing as an explicit re-presentation of the outside world inside a person's head. An alternative to the Cartesian metaphor is the ecology metaphor which examines the relationship and interactions between the components within a system. The primary implications of an ecological perspective rest in the evaluative criteria that this perspective brings to qualitative inquiry. (Twenty-five references are included.) (KEH)",

(3) How frequently did the terms Democrat and Republican or words associated with those terms appear with the words Hispanic and Latino, and in what context? and (4) What was the number of news articles in comparison to the number of opinion columns?

The &quot;mutilated boy&quot; rumor was chosen for its antiquity and endurance, its powerful theme, and its ability to create intense anxiety in a community. Thirty-three of the 86 editors who responded to the questionnaires reported encounters with the &quot;mutilated boy&quot; or similar rumors. The encounter questionnaire revealed that 14 of the 20 editors who said their newspaper printed something about the rumor also reported their readers stopped calling and the rumors quickly died. Fifty-one of the 53 editors who responded to the hypothetical questionnaire said they would assign someone to check out the rumor if their papers started receiving calls from  readers. Most agreed ignoring rumors generally is best but that they should be debunked if they create widespread hysteria. Those who favored printing a debunking story about the rumors favored it for the same reason other editors opposed printing it: responsibility to the community. No evidence was found to suggest that the press contributed to the spread of rumors. The summative picture is one of concerned editors, even though there are few written policies to guide their decisions. The fear of making matters worse is evident in the steadfast presence of the minority of editors who said they did not or would not print such a story.

Using a differentiation model for delineating the nature and boundaries of American adversarial journalism, the study re-analyzed the data from two national surveys.

The other (by Stinnett et al.) involved questionnaires mailed to 1,211 journalists at U.S. daily newspapers. Results of the re-analysis revealed: (1) that while young and old journalists take a moderate position on the usefulness of an adversary press, the middle-aged cohort has increased adversarial sentiment over the last 5 years; and  (2) that these intra-cohort trends may be explained by three factors: age, cohort, and period.

Using the GENCA program that matches a user-constructed vocabulary list with text files, the study analyzed randomly sampled sentences from the front pages of the two newspapers. Levels of attribution increased over time in both newspapers. The level of institutional sources (defined as all government or state-related sources) also increased over time, and certain types of institutional sources, such as executive-level government officials and anonymous sources, showed a dramatic increase. These  trends suggest that although reporters are using more attribution over time, the sources they are turning to are likely to be central, official, government sources. (Author/MM)",

Findings revealed that: (1) newspaper and magazine music criticism differs significantly in one particular way, i.e., though the numbers are small, magazines  exclude negative reviews as a matter of policy significantly more than do newspapers; (2) whether by policy or not, music critics estimate that they write few negative reviews, categorizing only about one-fifth of their reviews as negative while reporting about one-half as positive; (3) music critics regard both negative and positive reviews as more influential than mixed reviews; (4) music critics overwhelmingly oppose various warning, rating, and labeling schemes; (5) critics assign highest priority to genuinely popular music genres, with rock leading the pack, followed by soul, jazz, and country; and (6) music critics assign high importance to diversion, escape from reality, and companionship in assessing the functions of music, but relatively low priority to sexual experience and  thrills.

        "description":"A national survey was conducted to determine what book-length works are currently being taught in public, parochial, and independent secondary schools (grades 7-12). Department chairs were asked to list the works which all students, in any English class, study. Although the rank ordering differed somewhat in the three samples, the top 10 titles included were identical in the public and Catholic school samples, and nearly so in the independent schools. Data compiled by author of required titles looked quite similar. William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens were among the most popular authors. There was considerable diversity in the grade levels at which titles were taught, but also some consistency in the levels at which specific titles were most likely  to be taught. Department heads were also asked to indicate assignment of the texts according to track. The correlation among the tracks in the titles that appeared, indicated that there was some differentiation between the high and low groups. The titles required by 30% or more of the public schools were summarized and compared with the results of a study done 25 years earlier. Changes of titles required in independent and Catholic schools since 1963 were also compared. To investigate differences in offerings in different communities the required authors were examined. The study reflects what is explicitly valued as the foundation of students' literary experience. (Nine tables of data are included; eight appendixes including titles listed according to type of school, grade, and track are  attached. The survey instrument is also appended.) (MG)",

In teaching Frost, as in teaching any poet, some sort of biographical background should be provided for students as a context through which the poet and his poetry are demystified. A judicious use of biographical detail can help to bring the poet and his poetry into a reader-friendly relationship with the students. Biography can often be used effectively in the service of overcoming the innate resistance students often express toward the reading and study of poetry. These facts about a poet can be  invoked to guide students to a more open, informed, enjoyable, and natural response to the poetry.

Three hundred forty K-3 students were pretested and posttested with the &quot;Poetry Concepts and Attitudes Questionnaire.&quot; The Daily Oral Reading of Poetry program was developed. An active research design, involving 20 classroom teachers, was chosen to field-test the 4-week program in elementary classrooms. Results indicated that most young children had definite concepts about poetry, though with many children they were not well-developed. Young children also exhibited a positive attitude about  poetry. Significant grade level differences existed and program participation significantly affected concepts and attitudes.

The baseline data generated in this project, which included the participation of 20 upper-grade undergraduate subjects studying group communication, provided the initial elements in developing measuring instruments to aid in identifying, defining, and explaining group member satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Results confirmed that the three variables identified by R. Heslin and D. Dunphy (1964) are important factors contributing to satisfaction. The data generated here, however, offer evidence contrary to the general assumption  suggested by P. J. Marston and M. L. Hecht (1988) that dissatisfaction is the logical and numerical opposite of satisfaction. These data also suggest that, on the whole, satisfaction is a global attribute as long as the group is moving in its expected direction. Also, the greater variation identified in the dissatisfaction factors in the testing of the situational items suggests that researchers need to consider a two-step approach to measuring group member satisfaction.

Nuttall suggests there are two main origins of speech: sounds of discomfort (cries, eventually leading to the speaker's sophisticated means of controlling his/her environment, i.e. persuasion) and sounds of pleasure (coos, the basis for communal exchange, i.e., conversation). Williams and Naremore explain the development of language form and function, characterizing the three general modes of speech as context-centered speech, sender-receiver-centered speech, and topic-centered speech. The two theories appear complementary:  the empirical findings of Williams and Naremore's modes of speech continuum may offer the theory of speech behavior some scientific validity, and the theoretical explanations presented in Nuttall's theory of speech behavior may serve as a basis for additional theoretical refinements and possible new research directions for the modes of speech continuum.

Such programs offer both threats and opportunities to the speech field. In many programs, faculty in other disciplines take responsibility for teaching aspects of oral communication within their own classrooms. Thus, students are exposed to aspects of oral communication, are not as afraid of it, discover the relevance to their own interest areas, and may seek out both introductory and advanced speech communication courses. SAC courses emphasize process as opposed to product; students learn the communication conventions of their fields; feedback is explicit and  specific; students explore expectations for uses of evidence; and, perhaps most importantly, communication is regarded as a mode of learning. The benefits of SAC include increased credibility and visibility for the speech discipline, the pointing out of needed research, and the challenge to examine--in light of the shift of theoretical focus from products to process--the methods for teaching public speaking. Speech departments must be clear about the institutional support required for SAC programs, and must be firm about limits and boundaries, consistently reminding others that speech courses and SAC courses are very different entities and accomplish different--if related--objectives.

The success of the French videotex network Minitel relies on 10 principles: (1) cost of terminals; (2) no-frills terminals; (3) understanding the needs and wants of videotex users; (4) proper timing of introduction; (5) centralized authority to manage the videotex system; (6) organizing competition in a favorable regulatory environment; (7) long-range goals orientation; (8) consolidated billing policy; (9) single-standard system; and (10) individualized mass medium. To examine how major U.S. telecommunications companies perceive the establishment  of an electronic directory service, a mail survey was sent to 12 executives in charge of planning and development in seven Regional Bell Operating Companies and five independent telephone companies. Ten returned completed questionnaires. Findings indicated that the Bell Companies are very likely to offer electronic white and yellow pages in the near future, while the independent companies seemed unlikely to do so; that telecommunications companies perceived it as unlikely that they will supply low-cost terminals for electronic white pages in the near future; and that the endorsement of a common standard is not likely.

Bundling can easily turn into block booking, the illegal practice of making programming available in indivisible units that harm competition. Litigation continues to occur in the motion picture industry as a result of block booking and is beginning to occur in the cable industry, where it is often called &quot;tying.&quot; Tying occurs when a programming service requires a system to take an unwanted  channel to attain a desired channel; litigation is being directed at services tying cable programs, motion picture studios, and cable operators. Such practices limit the ability of programmers to negotiate prices based on the economic forces of supply and demand. As a result, many stations are forced to pay higher prices for products they would prefer to reject. In addition, bundling and block booking limit the ability to bargain for discounts for using programming in several markets in which a broadcaster may own properties and to barter advertising time for programming. With mergers such as that of Time and Warner Communications creating vertical integration in the programming industry, the linkages of program production, distribution, and exhibition grow stronger and provide more  incentive for distributors to engage in economic practices that disadvantage local firms who provide delivery to audiences.

        "description":"A study examined how Alabama legislators' ratings of news media for job-relevant information correlate with their views on news media adversary and consensus agent roles. Eighty-two questionnaires (out of 140 mailed) were completed by Alabama state representatives and senators for a return rate of 59%. Results suggested that lawmakers who believe news media do adversarial reporting are more unlikely or unwilling to credit them with providing useful job-relevant information, while lawmakers who do use news media for job-relevant information were significantly less likely to describe those media as engaging in aggressive, watchdog reporting. Results also indicated that the belief that news media function as agents of community consensus is correlated with use of media, thus making  it possible for those media to serve as constituent-legislator links. Results suggest an interesting consequence of the adversary posture many news media take: that stereotyping of news media as adversaries may preclude the news media from serving what could be an important &quot;linkage&quot; function.

        "author":["Wittebols, James H."],
        "description":"This paper presents a typology of terrorism which is grounded in how media differentially cover each type. The typology challenges some of the basic assumptions, such as that the media &quot;allow&quot; themselves to be exploited by terrorists and &quot;encourage&quot; terrorism, and the conventional wisdom about the net effects of the media's portrayal of each type of terrorism. The model emphasizes the amount of coverage each form of terrorism receives, the flavor or tone of the coverage, and the political effects of such coverage in influencing public opinion and consciousness. The paper discusses two types of terror: grievance terror, identified as terror which challenges power, and institutional terror, which seeks to maintain the status quo and power. The paper concludes that in assessing the  net effects of the way terrorism is covered there are several dimensions: a de-emphasis and reframing of United States/state sponsored terror, the portrayal of anti-United States grievance terror as irrational and without just cause, and a siege mentality among the larger population resulting from the way news skews the coverage toward grievance terror committed against U.S./Western interests and away from terror resulting from United States government policies.

        "description":"A study examined the shift of the United States public's primary news source from newspapers to radio and then to television between 1937 and 1987 to determine the validity of the generally accepted explanation that people have shifted media (displacement). Two alternative processes were discovered that could also account for this phenomenon: (1) the wording of the question has changed, and (2) people have grown up with different media--a &quot;cohort&quot; effect. A cohort analysis of the original Roper Poll data collected between 1937 and 1987 revealed that question wording differences, differences across cohorts, and displacement effects within cohorts were each responsible for some of this change in primary news source. The results also suggest that television has displaced radio more  than newspapers, compatible with the concept of a functional equivalence between the two electronic media.

Following an introductory section, the first section deals with the First Amendment and the media. The cable television monopoly is the topic of the second section; a third section discusses telecomputing. The telephone monopoly is treated in the fourth section, and the future of electronic publishing in the fifth. The conclusion asserts that telco exclusion from electronic publishing is no longer constitutional,  and that telcos should be free to enter electronic publishing with any regulations on that freedom narrowly tailored to suit the specific threats telcos pose in the communications marketplace.

        "description":"The telecommunications industry has now entered the most critical period of evolution in television technology since the introduction of color television. The transition to high definition television (HDTV), with related technologies such as semiconductors and computers, would mean a multi-billion dollar business for the telecommunications industry. With its enormous economic impact, HDTV now becomes one of the most important policy issues of the nation. HDTV is both visual-and-audio-improved television with a wider aspect ratio. However, this advanced television requires a new transmission standard and more spectra. Currently, broadcasters, direct broadcast satellite operators, cable and telephone companies, as well as HDTV production equipment and videocassette recorder  manufacturers, compete with one another to have a share in HDTV business. With its tremendous impact on the American economy, HDTV should be guided by the appropriate public policies from government and industry. Some suggestions for government policies are outlined under the following headings: government-industry cooperation; government funding; tax incentives; legislation; relief of the antitrust laws; and international cooperation and technology transfer. It is expected that the government will pay more attention to the rapid progress in the telecommunication industries and come up with appropriate policies and actions in the near future. HDTV represents a major policy and economic challenge to America at this time. (Twenty-eight references are appended.) (MS)",

        "description":"The ultimate test of the speech-action dichotomy, as it relates to symbolic speech to be considered by the courts, may be the fasting of prison inmates who use hunger strikes to protest the conditions of their confinement or to make political statements. While hunger strikes have been utilized by prisoners for years as a means of protest, it was not until 1982 that the courts attempted to define the rights of such protestors or to sort out the countervailing state interests leading to force-feeding, the state's usual response to such dissent. The central question is: How have the courts in recent decisions balanced the expression and privacy claims of the fasting prisoner with the state's interest in suicide prevention, maintaining order and security in prisons, and the state's  obligation to protect the health and welfare of persons in its custody? Recent court decisions that involve inmate hunger-strikers who claim that their fasting deserves constitutional protection as symbolic speech and that force-feeding amounts to an invasion of privacy indicate that the balance has tipped strongly in favor of prison officials who carry out state interests. It is also evident from recent cases that when free expression consists largely of conduct, the courts feel that the state has a broad power to regulate such conduct without infringing upon First Amendment protection.

Recognition of visual and audio information in 28 Bush-Dukakis commercials was generally quicker and more accurate for negative messages than for positive ads, or for ads that combined positive and negative information.  There were three categories of messages: ads negative throughout, ads positive throughout, and ads that began negative and finished positive. In the case of negative and positive ads, ratings steadily increased during the first 20 seconds, peaked, and then declined for the remaining 10 seconds. Ratings for negative-positive ads began negative and ended positive, but never achieved the intensity of the other two categories. &quot;Liking&quot; during the last 10 seconds was negatively related to recognition memory for material in the commercials.

The number of pictures differed significantly from one candidate to the other, but the presidential debates had no effect on the number of pictures published by each magazine.

A study examined evening network television stories about the 1988 Yellowstone Park wildfires as a case study in the sociology of news. Four panels of experts (fire incident commanders and forest ecologists) were assembled to examine and evaluate videotaped network evening news stories about the Yellowstone fires on five-part Likert-type scales. To get journalists' perspectives, telephone interviews were conducted with the correspondent from each  network who reported the largest number of stories about the fires and also with either a producer or regional bureau chief at each network who supervised coverage of the fires. Further information was obtained in personal interviews with key Yellowstone Park officials who dealt with reporters during the fires. Analysis showed that the TV networks covered the fires in a stylized and stereotyped way. The news stories did a poor job of serving educated nonspecialists seeking the information necessary to arrive at informed conclusions about the relevant ecological issues and related land management policies.

Brummett's &quot;consensus criticism&quot; and G. Lakoff and M. Johnson's theory of metaphors. Analysis revealed that international students used four dominant metaphors in their perceptions as well as expressions of  love: love as a product; love as play; love as a contract; and love as responsibility.

Part I examines characteristics of today's educational leaders; effective leadership styles and qualities; administrator training, hiring, and induction methods; and the scarcity of female and black school leaders. Part II looks at the organizational supports underlying school leadership. This section examines the balance of authority between the central office and the school site, the team approach to management, the decision-making context, and the components of school climate. Part III highlights  leadership abilities needed by today's school administrators. Besides knowing how to manage the school's instructional program and staff, administrators must be able to communicate in today's more open, sharing organization; build coalitions of community groups; make meetings more productive; and manage time, stress, and conflict more effectively. Concerned about integrating theory with practice, the book offers many practical suggestions for using the information presented.

Modern researchers tend to stress nurture over nature. Studies of biographical factors (IQ, birth order, childrearing styles, and socioeconomic variables) show that leaders are more intelligent than nonleaders, not first-born, used to making decisions from an early age, and from a higher socioeconomic group than followers. In the human relations area, leaders are above average at social interaction, are people-oriented, and are good talkers and listeners. Traits that distinguish  effective from ineffective leaders include strong goal orientation, self-confidence, and proactivity--the ability to act, rather than passively react. Reasonable intelligence and good communication skills are worthy criteria for selecting, evaluating, and training school administrators. In promotion decisions, superiors should consider those with clear, well-articulated goals and the intitiative and determination to accomplish them. Although the above depiction of the \"ideal\" leader is sketchy, the composite picture may help administrators with evaluation and priority-setting tasks. (MLH)",

Although most experts agree that leadership style is important, they disagree concerning style components, leaders' capabilities for changing styles, the effects of personality traits on style, and the desirability of flexible styles. Style theories may be broadly categorized according to decision-making behaviors, views of subordinates, focus on work or people, and approaches to facilitating organizational change. Actually, effective leaderhip defies categorization; there is no ideal approach to fit all situations. Whether relation- or task-oriented, leaders need to adapt their styles to the management situation, to followers' maturity levels, and to  other contingencies (role expectations, personality characteristics, time constraints, political considerations, and interpersonal tensions). Although leadership style theories differ significantly, all have implications for better leadership. Each can be used as a basis for training and selecting leaders and for enhancing one's own leadership style. (MLH)",

Unfortunately, administrator training and selection methods are often ill-suited to developing and employing outstanding leaders. Traditional avenues to the principalship, including university coursework and teaching and administrative experience, have not proved satisfactory. Practitioners complain the most about deficiencies in graduate training. Three classroom bridging procedures (performance simulations, case studies, and games) offer some promising new training strategies. Various field-based experiences are also recommended, along with school district-sponsored programs. To make  principal recruitment less haphazard, the applicant pool must be expanded through outside recruitment, career ladders, internships, and training programs. The principal selection process can be improved by revamping selection criteria and vacancy announcement, screening, and interviewing practices. Innovative principal induction programs, such as peer-assisted leadership, are also needed. Districts can help orient beginning principals by instituting buddy systems, structuring the workload, giving feedback, and developing professional growth plans. Practitioners anxious to capitalize on the coming \"window of opportunity\" offered by retiring principals can use the above strategies to assess the status of their methods for preparing, recruiting, selecting, and inducting principals.

After decades of civil rights legislation and women's movement activities, there are fewer women and minority school administrators than there were 35 years ago. Arguing persuasively for educational diversity, the chapter first examines the attitudes and practices impeding both groups' progress. Women have been hampered by sex role stereotyping; negative attitudes of superiors and coworkers; lack of networks and mentors; and school consolidation efforts, which often result in fewer available positions. Although women's representation in administration, especially the principalship, has improved during the 1980s, blacks' representation  has increased only slightly. During the 1960s, after the Supreme Court's historic desegregation ruling, the number of black school principals in 13 southern and border states actually dropped over 95 percent. The legal system of segregation has been replaced by an urban residential segregation that relegates black administrators to mostly black schools. Black administrators share numerous problems: difficult and financially troubled schools, role ambiguities, and unrealistic expectations from others. Compared with women, there are fewer blacks and other minorities in the graduate training \"pipeline\" for administrative positions. Affirmative action programs have had limited effects during the 1980s. Recent progress toward establishing hiring priorties, eliminating pay inequalities,  developing a candidate clearinghouse, improving recruitment methods, and revamping training and internship programs is assessed.

In site management, the school is the primary decision-making unit. Decisions concerning expenditures, curricula, and personnel are made by school site staff, with help from parents, students, and community members. Although the school board continues to formulate and define the district's policies and educational objectives, the central office role is altered from &quot;dictator&quot; to &quot;facilitator&quot; of individual schools' actions. School-based management tackles educational administration's highly bureaucratic structure by balancing decentralization and centralization, or autonomy and control. The development of school-based management  in Florida and California districts is outlined. Three other systems, in Florida, Massachusetts, and Colorado are analyzed. New interrelationships among the school board, the central office, and the principal in school-based systems are discussed, along with three critical control areas (curriculum, personnel, and budget). Finally, the benefits of shared decision-making imparted by staff and community input and school-based management councils are outlined. (MLH)",

Although team management has been variously defined, in this chapter the focus is on a formally constituted group of experienced central office and building level administrators committed to a structured decision-making process endorsed by the school board and the superintendent. Popular in the 1960s as a response to collective bargaining, team management has proved effective in broadening decision-making participation and improving administrative efficiency. Since  team management approaches differ, each district must find a responsive model and modify it to meet district needs. Management teams vary according to membership and organization type, degree of power and trust, board-administrator agreement, decision-making style, and evaluation method. Successful team management demands strong commitment to trust and shared decision-making among all participants. Team design is also crucial, especially regarding communication channels. Successful team management efforts in Yakima, Washington; Rio Linda, California; and Attleboro, Massachusetts are described.

A cornerstone of a reform movement to make organizational operations more democratic and less authoritarian, PDM may be excercised in various ways. It is an essential feature of both team and school-based management, and does not require significant alteration of the school governance power structure. Although the administrator in charge retains authority and responsibility for PDM-based decisions, the process is a high-risk undertaking. However, PDM has numerous advantages over more traditional methods, including better decisions,  higher employee satisfaction, and better relations between management and staff. Guidelines for implementing PDM advise administrators to vary their decision-making styles and to proceed gradually toward PDM. Brief descriptions of a teacher leadership team in an Indianapolis (Indiana) high school, the School Improvement Process in Hammond (Indiana), the quality circles program in Oregon City (Oregon), and the Quality of Work Life process in Duluth (Minnesota), illustrate the effectiveness of the PDM technique for motivating others.

Although experts differ over measurement techniques, several systems for characterizing organizational climate (by measuring staff communication patterns) have been devised. Two helpful instruments are the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire and the National Association of Secondary School Principals school survey. Effective schools research findings  show the influence of school climate on morale and educational outcomes. As a first step to improving school climate, principals must understand the cyclical, self-perpetuating nature of organizational climate and consider their role in the change process. Numerous climate improvement models exist, including organizational development, behavior modification, the Reaching Success through Involvement Program, and school climate improvement teams. Scanning the literature for administrator-generated articles can also provide practical suggestions. (MLH)",

Leading the instructional program requires both an understanding of educational technique and a personal vision of academic excellence that can be translated into effective classroom strategies. Research shows that principals can have a profound indirect effect on students' learning experiences. This influence is shaped by the community and institutional context and by the principal's management style and personal temperament. Of the many tasks performed by principals, five most clearly influence a school's instructional program: (1) defining the school mission; (2) managing the curriculum and instruction; (3) promoting a positive learning  climate; (4) observing and giving feedback to teachers; and (5) assessing the instructional program. Principals' instructional leadership duties should not be overemphasized at the expense of unofficial leadership found in schools. The key to effective instructional leadership may well lie in principals' flexibility in sharing duties and their ingenuity at matching these duties with the appropriate department heads, assistant principals, or teacher committees. Understanding the critical leadership functions is a good first step toward creating an effective learning environment. (MLH)",

Because the teacher marketplace is increasingly competitive, aggressive recruiting is needed to obtain the best teachers, including minority candidates. Teacher selection is especially challenging due to teaching function complexity, insufficient attention to hiring, and inadequate selection techniques. To improve this situation, administrators must redesign interviews, beware of attraction to similarities, stress  general cognitive ability and academic achievement, and require work sample measures.

A meeting takes shape  as the participants are invited, the seating arrangements are determined, the meeting room is arranged, and the agendas and background information are distributed. Using the agenda as a road map, the leader guides the group through the problem-solving and decision-making maze, remaining alert to negative energy and maintaining the group's equanimity as needed. As decisions are made, the leader helps designate responsibilities and sets action deadlines. After the meeting, the leader distributes the minutes or executive summary, follows up on the decisions made, and evaluates the meeting's effectiveness.

Leaders with an overall purpose in mind more easily clarify their role and its functions, objectives, and areas of responsibility. &quot;Classical&quot; time-management strategies include goal-setting and prioritizing, using a daily time-log, and reducing time-wasters (visitors, telephone calls, paperwork, procrastination, and the inability to say &quot;no&quot; or  to schedule or delegate). Since time and stress management are corrrelated, each requires the same approach: a shift in attitude and awareness level, self-analysis and identification of stressors in the daily stress log, and practical management techniques. The Social Readjustment Rating Scale can help orient administrators to common stressors and their relative magnitudes. Practical suggestions are provided for managing controllable and uncontrollable stressors and for handling organizational stress affecting employees. Increased teacher support, collegial sharing networks, and employee wellness programs can work wonders. (MLH)",

        "description":"Chapter 15 of a revised volume on school leadership, this chapter defines and categorizes conflict and outlines techniques for its management in schools. Conflict, endemic to human existence, exists on many levels and assumes various forms. This chapter focuses on social conflict, or antagonistic interaction between individuals or groups common to the school environment. The art of conflict management involves maximizing constructive conflict and minimizing destructive conflict. To achieve this end, the school administrator must understand conflict--its types, sources, and dynamics--and must master various techniques for managing it. Conflict can be classified by degree of constructiveness/destructiveness, by the kind of issues involved, and by degree of severity. Sources of  conflict include communication problems, organizational structure, human factors, and competition over limited resources. Stages of conflict range from anticipation to discussion to open opposition. Since no one conflict resolution method is best, administrators should be aware of all possible techniques, including: (1) avoidance; (2) containment by redressing individual grievances; (3) creation of superordinate goals to motivate cooperation; (4) creative problem-solving; (5) compromise; (6) changes in organizational structure; (7) authoritative command; and (8) reconciliation of conflicting parties' differences. Knowledge alone is not enough; administrators need field experience to develop their conflict management skills. (MLH)",

Three criterion groups, selected to represent increasing levels of average performance, received surveys that generated response rates of 27 percent for the general principal group, 33 percent for the superintendent or research nominees group, and 33 percent for the nationally distinguished principal group. The survey included a seven-item composite (developed in a prior construction sample) that proved moderately efficient in discriminating high performing principals from principals-in-general in two cross-validation samples; the  composite also identified modest positive correlations with principals' self-ratings of job performance. No significant sex or race differences in composite scores were observed. The results suggest the feasibility of using simple, inexpensive biographical inventories to supplement existing methods for selecting principals. (18 references and 3 tables) (KM)",

Data collected for each of 420 randomly selected students included: (1) mastery and nonmastery ratings on each of the essential skills in language arts, affective education, and mathematics; (2) attendance, length of enrollment, and citizenship information; and (3) standardized achievement test scores. Data indicate that males are more likely to be retained than females. Students proposed for retention exhibited poorer attendance, citizenship, and attainment of essential skills than did students proposed for promotion. Hispanic students appear to be more highly represented in the retained group than are students who  carry other ethnic codes. Citizenship ratings are poorer for students proposed for retention than for those proposed for promotion. The major recommendation of the study is strategy development at each school to improve students' attendance, citizenship, and other factors related to attending to the business of school.

His yearly salary is about $50,000, and the position he holds is classified rather than certificated. Thirty-seven percent had prior outside experience in business, the military, or civil service. The CBO  depended upon personal contacts for advancement. In relation to career paths and preparation, most CBOs had a master's degree. They concurred that budget preparation was the principal skill needed. The CBOs expressed satisfaction with their jobs but were most concerned about the need for a balance between required tasks and allocated resources.

The study had four parts: (1) an analysis of credit accumulation for four cohorts and academic achievement patterns over 4 years in 16 schools; (2) an examination of eight exemplary programs aimed at students who take mainly general-level courses; (3) an examination of eight exemplary programs for students taking basic-level courses; and (4) an analysis of the extent to which part-time work influences school leaving. The part-time work survey was administered in 13 schools to 4,620 students in grades 11 and above, and the telephone interview was conducted with 610 dropouts from  22 schools. The main findings support the following conclusions: (1) The vast majority of dropouts were taking mainly general-level courses at the time of leaving school, and the students who took mainly basic-level courses were at a particularly high risk of dropping out. (2) The vast majority of dropouts left school because they were so far behind in credit accumulation that the likelihood of graduation was too remote. (3) The fact that students were working more than 20 hours per week had an adverse effect on achievement. (4) There is little evidence that part-time work contributes to the decision of students to leave school early. (5) There is little evidence of a decrease in dropouts occurring because of more relevant programming. (6) There is some evidence that student evaluation  emphasizing attendance and work habits contributes to an increase in school retention. (Author/JAM)",

The first focuses on the social ecology of high schools, looking at how they relate to their environment. The second focuses on organizational characteristics that others have reported are associated with more effective schools. The third, an ethnographic approach, views the world through the eyes of students in the process of dropping out. The fourth focuses on the transition from school to work viewed as a rite of passage. A literature review to identify variables, questionnaire surveys, and case studies of schools were the research methods used. All staff members in all secondary schools in six public school board districts in  various parts of the province received questionnaires. Survey data were used from 58 of the 95 high schools, and 2,250 questionnaires were analyzed. Seven school sites in four school board districts were selected for the case studies. The evidence collected for this study suggests that increasing numbers of students are dropping out of Ontario high schools. Furthermore, the impact of school and student culture on variation in retention rates was established. (Author/JAM)",

State authorities have established both incentive systems to reward high-performing school districts and systems of sanctions to be applied to districts with a record of repeated low performance. To accomplish this, a majority of states are now collecting from local districts a formidable array of statistics on student performance, including, at the very least, student achievement test scores, minimum competency scores, or both. Incentives are generally of two types: financial and deregulatory. Consequences of a state takeover of a district are also discussed. (13 references) (SI)",

This study maintains that before changing existing structures, it is necessary to examine and improve the current decision making process. The report outlines 12 guidelines for successful decision making that not only lead to decisions that stay made, but contribute as well to the organizational health of the school, department, or district. The 12 guidelines, which reflect recent thinking in organizational theory on group processes, are divided among three stages (planning, deciding, and implementing). The study considers these guidelines to constitute a framework for decision making to be used prospectively and  retrospectively. A hypothetical scenario shows what dysfunctional decision making looks like and leads to, and proposes alternatives for effective decision making. The report suggests that adherence to the 12 guidelines leads to improved organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and morale. (3 references) (KM)",

A shuttle survey was designed to verify what information states collect on revenues and expenditures. Through an iterative process, the shuttle allowed for increasingly accurate information to be obtained. A total of 46 states participted. The project examined a comparison of the states' accounting handbook; revenue data; and local, intermediate, state, and federal sources of revenue collection. States were also asked to confirm the classification of expenditures by function, program, and object categories. Because allocation of  federal programs is determined in part by attendance and expenditure data, additional analysis was done on current expenditures, nonpublic students, computers and software, summer school, and other programs. The project was able to, in part, develop recommendations for standardizing and improving the reporting of current expenditures, attendance measures, and per pupil expenditures. The collection of further and comparable data from states will allow for more accurate state comparisons to be made, will facilitate the tracking of fiscal issues through the years, and will help the Federal Government ensure more equitable distribution of federal funds.

It is the Administration's expectation that (1) everyone in America be educated to their fullest potential, a situation that can only result when all students remain in school and the term &quot;dropout&quot; becomes obsolete; (2) access to education must be ensured for not only the academically talented, but also for those living in poverty, the at-risk students, and the handicapped; and (3) all American citizens must  be held accountable to the nation relative to the quality of education the country provides. The establishment of merit school programs using state standards under federal guidance would provide both official recognition and financial support to schools that are accountable and effective.

Essay I, &quot;Appraising the Funding Status of Teacher Pensions: An Econometric Approach,&quot; examines the funding status of teacher pension plans for the 50 states and for selected localities for the decade 1971-1980. Based on a pension underfunding equation, the results reveal that the dollar value of plan underfundings have risen by over 50 percent in the average state from 1971 to 1980. Essay II, &quot;Funding Teacher Pensions or Does Paul Rob Peter to Pay Mary?&quot; seeks to answer the question of why some state plans are well funded and others are poorly funded. The analysis examines two central determinants of underfundings: pension benefits and  pension contributions. Three models of state pension policymaking are discussed. Results indicate that there is a slow downward drift in the level of underfundings, and there seems to be no national teacher pension crisis on the fiscal horizon. However, the system does deserve continued scrutiny over the next two decades. (49 references) (SI)",

Students are identified for the program through standardized test scores, teacher recommendation, student interest, work samples, and a cognitive abilities test. Six instructional strategies support the AIM High curriculum: problem-solving, higher-level thinking, research skills, creative and productive thinking, writing as a process, and rapid mastery of the basics. Following an introductory section, this manual contains sections on organization of the AIM High Program at individual schools; the process of identifying students for AIM High; the  instruments used in identifying students; special considerations in identifying students, including information on transfer students, student improvement plans, and program exit procedures; the AIM High language arts curriculum, mathematics curriculum, science curriculum, and bilingual curriculum; characteristics and training of AIM High teachers; giftedness definitions and characteristics of gifted students; and principles of differentiated curricula.

Subjects were 43 general educators, their 43 most difficult-to-teach nonhandicapped students, and 12 school consultants, representing seven inner-city middle schools. Among 31 experimental teachers, 10, 10, and 11 teachers were randomly assigned to a least, more, and most inclusive variant of BC, respectively. Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up observations of student behavior indicated that more inclusive BC versions exerted stronger effects than the least inclusive variant in reducing problem behavior. While  more inclusive versions of BC require more time and energy from school personnel, consultants found that these versions required only an average of 6 hours of their time per student. Conducting a least-inclusive version of BC was found to be better than taking no action at all. (Author/JDD)",

They may or may not require special education. These children were previously unserved in educational settings. Estimation of their numbers is difficult, but as many as 100,000 infants and children may be technologically dependent in some way. Their conditions may include ventilator dependence, tracheostomy dependence, oxygen dependence, nutritional supplement dependence, congestive heart problems, need for long-term care, apnea monitoring, and kidney dialysis. Unique medical needs must be met before the students can benefit from educational experiences. Fatigue, limited vitality, short attention span, and limited  mobility may accompany technological dependence. Before the children enter the classroom, teachers should consider several possible environmental and intervention adaptations. Medical complications must be considered when developing schedules and curricular plans. Of considerable concern is the teacher tendency to overcompensate for handicaps. Curricular modifications may be similar to those adopted for students with physical disabilities. Parents, siblings, and families play an important role in habilitation and management of health care needs, promotion of independence, and coping. Interdisciplinary planning can enhance the positive impact of the learning experience. (MSE)",

It also contributes to disproportionate representation of those students in special education. These children suffer from the stigma of being labelled handicapped and may lose ground academically. Formal prereferral intervention is recommended, governed by a clearly articulated set of procedures followed by all personnel. Teacher assistance teams can be used to facilitate prereferral problem-solving. This process provides valuable insights for classroom teachers and team  members regarding potential sources of student difficulties and can help distinguish learning problem types. At each step of the process, specific questions should address such issues as the problem; curricula and instructional materials; teacher characteristics; teaching style; teacher expectations and perceptions; student characteristics such as language proficiency, culture, and socioeconomic status; exposure to the curriculum; evaluation of instructional effectiveness; and alternative interventions. Prereferral intervention in which the major objective is to improve the effectiveness of regular education is a cost-effective approach. (MSE)",

Curricula specifically designed for special needs students include the &quot;Special Education Curriculum on Sexual Exploitation&quot; for mildly handicapped students and &quot;Self-Protection for the Handicapped&quot; for moderately/severely mentally handicapped students. To implement the curricula in a school district requires that administrator approval be acquired, that teachers receive inservice training, and that parents preview curriculum materials and air their concerns. Actual teaching of sexual abuse prevention curriculum can then take place. Instruction should occur in a group rather than in an individualized format, in 30- to 45-minute sessions each  day for 24 weeks, using materials adapted to meet the needs of the particular students. It is important that concepts and skills be mastered before discussion of exceptions occurs. The efficacy of the curricula was evaluated by placing trained and untrained students in potentially exploitative simulations. The trained students performed significantly better than untrained students, indicating that classroom training generalized to perceived realistic situations. (JDD)",

        "description":"This bibliographic review aims to present a single comprehensive source of references to facilitate clinical application of data obtained on the vocal activity of normal infants and to facilitate continued research on prelinguistic vocal output. The bibliography cites the published observational, empirical, and theoretical reports that examine the normal infant's noncry vocalization. Over 300 citations are listed, from the late 1800's to 1987. Citations are restricted to those discussions in which some type of analysis was attempted or completed on infant subjects' actual noncry utterances, whether the analysis was articulatory, acoustic, linguistic, phonatory, descriptive, or behavioral. The bibliography emphasizes studies of normal vocal functioning, but also includes studies  that first established a normal baseline against which to compare a selected risk population. Dissertations and presented papers are not included, and only selected chapters are drawn from full-length books on infant vocalization. (JDD)",

The ABC is a process model for training teachers how to plan, assess, implement, and evaluate instruction. Teachers first learn the ABC model in order to effectively use the \"I CAN\" resource materials. The \"I CAN\" resource materials are designed to cover the scope (primary through secondary) and essential content typically addressed in physical education, with accommodations made for students functioning at a wide range of levels (zero competency to advanced). The program is competency-based for both the  teachers and their students. Certified trainers conduct workshops on assessing students' performance levels, prescribing instructional activities, teaching individualized instruction in group settings, and evaluating student change and program effectiveness. Teachers are subsequently monitored on their implementation competencies, and receive feedback. The program's performance objectives cover such areas of motor development as aquatics, locomotor skills, body awareness, physical fitness, dance, team sports, individual/dual sports, and outdoor activities. The appendices include a list of training and resource materials, an outline of student performance objectives, and a set of resource materials for the performance of the overhand throw. (JDD)",

The 30 adult (mean age: 18 years) deaf subjects were asked to identify emotional states of photographed actors. Results generally indicated that deaf individuals are neither better nor worse at identifying emotional expressions than normal speaking and hearing individuals, though the six profoundly deaf subjects did score significantly lower than both partially deaf and normal hearers. There were no significant differences between scores of male and female deaf subjects. Deaf subjects, however, scored much lower than hearing subjects in identifying the emotion of disgust, often confusing it with the emotions of anger and sadness, a finding possibly  explained by the nature of the sign language gesture for disgust.

Critical issues identified include maximizing private and public sector initiatives; improving communication among developers, producers,  and consumers; and translating research on effective applications into practice. The second report provides statistical data on the availability of adaptive hardware; proportions of devices that are assistive, computer input, or computer output devices; device functions; and design features. The final report presents data indicating that the population of students with handicaps (especially learning disabilities) is rising. It notes that federal funds constitute about 5% of total special education expenditures and that costs for educating handicapped students run about double the costs of educating regular students. The last report also discusses the educational environments of special students, related services, percentages of students exiting from secondary schools, and special  education personnel. (DB)",

The study examined one part of special education--how the school system initially identifies students for special services. The study reviewed 650 students to determine how many received a handicapped code and which code they received. The investigation monitored a subsample of 302 students to determine what happended when students received a referral to Educational Management Teams (EMT) and School Admissions, Review, and Dismissal (SARD) committees. Results showed that the profile of students seen to be at risk closely matched participation figures for receipt of  special education services, with Black students more likely and Asian students less likely to be coded as handicapped compared to majority group students. The most common category was learning disabilities, followed by speech/language impairments. The functions of the EMT and the SARD were poorly differentiated; the EMT was frequently not fulfilling its problem solving function prior to referral for identification of a handicapping condition. Several inconsistencies in diagnostic evaluation and due process practices surfaced. (JDD)",

Following a series of term definitions, the historical review begins with a focus on the French, Germans, and English in the 1700's and early 1800's. American pioneers are then discussed, focusing on the work of Samuel Gridley Howe and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Several controversial issues are then examined, including teaching the deaf through oralism versus  manualism, residential versus local schools, vocational training versus academic education, and training of teachers.

Requests were for either action or for information. In both age groups, children used direct form and embedded imperatives more often when the hero addressed a friend. The hero employed hints more frequently when he addressed the enemy. The 6-year olds produced more indirect utterances than did the 7-year-olds; however, the 7-year-olds  evidenced a clear ability to produce a variety of reformulations.

It is possible to predict clear syntactic differences between a grammatical agreement marker and a morphologically incorporated pronoun. What is required is a theory of grammatical function that integrates the properties of argument functions, such as subject and object; and discourse functions, such as topic and focus. An analysis of this aspect of Chichewa, a Bantu language, indicates that important parameters of change and variation lie in surface form--the external phonologically interpreted morphology and phrase structures. The pronominal incorporation property is such a parameter; when it is combined with  postulations about grammatical theory and discourse function, fundamental differences appear to be explained between syntactic structures organized by grammatical agreement with governed functions and anaphoric agreement with discourse functions.

It is proposed that Kall is better described as involving primarily a reduplication of the prosodic word. The first section examines Wolof syllable structure, detailing the surface syllable types, the representation of complex segments, and the syllabification principles of the language. The second section describes the different types of Kall and the phonological and morphological processes taking place. It also provides a prosodic analysis of the secret code, stressing the role of the syllable and the phonological word. The importance of secret code varieties  in confirming the internal structure of the syllable in Wolof is shown. In particular, independently phonological rules (such as schwa insertion, glottal stop insertion and degemination) are shown to operate in the building or rebuilding of syllables of the secret code.

        "description":"Significant advances in hardware and software have increased the possible applications for educating limited-English-proficient students. Two major studies have focused on technology and its relationship to the education of this population. There is a great diversity of hardware currently in use in schools, either stand-alone computers or computer networks. Several emerging technologies have potential applications: videocassette recorders, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), videodisks, and computers that recognize speech. There is also a variety of available software in the form of drill and practice, tutorials, simulations, games, and applications of databases, spreadsheets, programming, authoring languages and systems, and word processing. Ideally, software should be both  instructional and intellectual, and whatever its use, software should not supplant the teacher but provide new methods and tools for learning. The use of word processing offers a number of advantages for teaching reading and writing to limited-English-proficient students. Factors affecting the successful implementation of technology include lack of appropriate software, inadequate software integration into the curriculum, lack of compatibility between hardware and software or between hardware components, lack of funding to support repairs and maintenance of computer systems, and lack of teacher training. Correction of these problems and increased student and teacher access are recommended. (MSE)",

        "description":"Evidence suggests that limited-English-proficient (LEP) students are among those most likely to drop out of school. Inconsistencies in defining dropouts and limited research affect estimates of LEP dropouts. Factors increasing the dropout risk include: low level of English language competence; large school size; lower expectations of certain ethnic and minority groups; inappropriate social behavior in class; personal reasons; and residential mobility. While the effects of dropping out of school are not fully understood, they appear to be substantial, including reduced earnings, limited employment opportunities, loss of psychological well-being; and resulting societal burden. Public dissatisfaction with public education has led to a school reform movement focusing on increasing  academic rigor for students and upgrading standards for teachers. Federal and state governments have responded to the dropout problem with various approaches and initiatives. The most important element in a dropout prevention program is identification of at-risk students. Research has revealed significant risk factors. Students drop out most frequently in high school, but intervention is warranted as soon as predictors identify students as being at risk. Dropout prevention program strategies include counseling, incentive and tutorial, work-related, and alternative curriculum approaches. A number of programs illustrate the ways in which strategies can be integrated. (MSE)",

In the second chapter, sound systems in general and sound production in particular are explained using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Individual alphabets of the three languages are also included. The third chapter provides an introduction to various geographic and proper names and to denotations of the seasons, months, days, numbers, and expressions of time. Criteria for choosing to study a particular language are outlined in chapter 4. In chapter  5, the diversity of linguistic thinking is illustrated by examining varieties of corresponding English, French, German, and Spanish idiomatic expressions. Equivalent proverbs are also used to show cultural differences expressed in language. The sixth chapter outlines grammatical terms and parts of speech for use in language comparisons.

The test design responded to the growing demand for a more efficient multiple-choice test of reading comprehension for large numbers of examinees. The study used discourse analysis to select the deletions and to examine their relationships to macro-structures in the text. Pilot testing with the varied university populations revealed the test to be statistically satisfactory. Recommendtions are that the test be used as: (1) a diagnostic test or as a test of language proficiency, with its  deletions adapted to its function; and (2) part of a battery of tests measuring other aspects of language proficiency.

The analyses focused on how children introduce new referents in discourse across four languages: English, French, German, and Mandarin Chinese. The data base consists of narratives produced by children between the ages of 4 and 10 based on two picture sequences. The study presented the narrative task to the children as a game in which they had to help a blindfolded interlocutor find out what happened in the stories. General tendencies and differences were observed across ages and languages. It was not until the children were 6 to 7 years of age that they used appropriate devices for introducing referents within the linguistic context. The  children marked their referent introductions with both NP types and NP position, although their reliance on these two types of linguistic devices varied as a function of the language being acquired. These results show the interplay of general cognitive factors, universal discourse pragmatic principles, and language-specific processes for determining the acquisition of linguistic devices during the development of discourse cohesion.

It is based on the Graduate Management Admission Council's New Matriculants Survey which gathered data on 2,053 first-year students at 91 U.S. graduate schools of business and management in 1985. Four sections are as follows: what students want from an MBA (e.g., individual variations in reasons for pursuing the MBA, other programs considered, and desired curriculum); what students expect from post-MBA employment (e.g., importance of selected job facets by amount of employment experience and type of school, and sources of dissatisfaction with current or most recent job); expected post-MBA employment changes (e.g.,  planned changes of employer and/or position, employment status, and type of occupation wanted); and expectations about attaining post-MBA employment objectives (i.e. level of optimism about future employment and length of time students expect to spend looking for desired job). Results include the following: career entry/advancement is the most frequently cited reason students pursue the MBA degree; what students want from the MBA appears to not vary at all by sex or enrollment status; there are meaningful variations in student ratings of importance among students with differing amounts of full-time employment experience; and almost half of the respondents want to change both their employer and position upon completion of the MBA.

        "description":"A description of the Graduate Management Admission Council's New Matriculants Survey focusing on school selection by Masters of Business Administration students is presented. Four sections are as follows: (1) reasons for applying and enrolling (including student differences in reasons for applying); (2) who applies to more than one school (e.g., demographic characteristics and school related characteristics); (3) do multiple admittees differ from multiple appliers (e.g., how many are admitted to more than one school and employment characteristics); and (4) reasons multiple admittees did not enroll in the second choice school. Highlights of the survey findings are: 60% of the respondents applied only to one school, school location was the single most important factor in the  students' application and enrollment decisions; and both school quality reasons and school cost or convenience factors are important to these application and enrollment choices. However, except among matriculants at the most highly competitive schools, convenience and/or cost reasons are consistently more important than school quality in this process of school selection by students.

This survey provides a representative national sample of graduate management students who are newly matriculated. This sample may be used for comparison of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students to other interesting student groups. It may also be used for analysis of the career decisions of MBA students and potential MBA students. The survey asks for information on personal and family background, occupational history,  educational background, financial status, personality characteristics, attitudes, decisions on graduate education, and expectations on type and quality of employment. Six appendices are as follows: table of relative efficiencies from different disproportionate allocations among school strata; summary of representative indicators from surveys related to the GMAC MBA Matriculant Survey; in-scope and out-of-scope programs for the GMAC Survey; issues explored in preliminary survey of schools; schools contacted in preliminary survey; and annotated bibliography.

        "description":"The conference addressed a trend in the education of minority students in Florida and the nation. While high school graduation rates of minorities have increased, minority enrollment in postsecondary education has decreased. A statewide study of 811 randomly selected high school seniors was undertaken to identify variables which may influence a student's decision to attend college. The study appears in its entirety in this monograph and addresses such topics as: the relationship among variables like career aspirations, career goals, and aspiration to attend college; the relationship between variables related to family circumstances and aspiration toward college; and the relationship between gender and educational and academic variables. Discussion of the findings related to these  topics served as the focal point for the conference. Study findings include the following: more than 70% of the respondents wanted to go to college, but only 31.9% of them applied; the vast majority of those surveyed believe college is necessary for success and want a good job in 5 years earning over $20,000; and family circumstances were related to aspiration to attend college (students from families earning over $20,000 per year tended to want to go to college more frequently). More majority students' fathers had gone to college, were in managerial or professional positions, and had a total family income of over $20,000 per year. Almost identical numbers of minority and majority students applied for college. (SM)",

        "description":"A historical report on the development of modern American graduate management education is presented. The central argument is that the period from the late 1940s to the early 1970s witnessed the rise of an unprecedented degree of autonomy in American management education. There are almost no systematically collected and accessible data with which to document how management education assumed its current shape within the academic community. By analyzing the process and pace of reform before and after the famous Ford Foundation and Carnegie Corporation reports of 1959 (which supposedly had a revolutionary impact on the theory and practice of modern management education), it is possible to provide a new empirical grounding for understanding the change process in management education.  Five sections focus on the following: the crisis in business leadership in the postwar decade; varieties of response in the postwar period: 1946-1955 (Michigan State, Northwestern, UCLA); the New Age of reform: 1955-1964 (Michigan State, Northwestern, UCLA); denouement: undergraduate business education and professional ideals; and postscript (brief sketches of broad developmental patterns based on scattered data for Michigan State University, Northwestern, and UCLA).

Directors of career development and placement services at each institution were sent a packet of material with surveys for each staff member. The survey contained a list of all academic programs specific to each institutions. They were asked to rate this year's expected labor market for each program they advised or were familiar with. Five tables  present the results according to: summary of demand for major classification of instructional programs (CIP) groups by degree level; demand ratings for specific programs at the certificate/associate level according to CIP numbers; demand for specific programs at the bachelors level according to CIP numbers; demand ratings for specific programs at the masters level according to CIP numbers; and demand ratings for specific programs at the doctoral/professional level according to CIP numbers.

Illustrations from Bay Street School (drawn from a 9-year research project on personal knowledge and narrative) are included. Since whatever may be said about narrative as method follows from its character as phenomenon, the aspects of narrative's phenomenal character necessary for discussing method are explained. The elements in an idea of narrative method are noted, with a focus on experience and time, personal knowledge, and reflection and deliberation. In addition, the process of narrative inquiry is discussed. One way to think of the process is that it is possible to find what can be described or accounted for within the experiential texts being created in the shared  narrative inquiry process. When researchers record field notes of participant observation, there is an interpretive quality involved. Interpretations are offered because one of the main functions of research from a narrativist point of view is to foster reflection and restorying by the participants. Part of the concern in narrative inquiry is with audience, and narrative researchers must consider issues of representation and audience. Narrative researchers set out their narrative purposes and an appropriate context; they then counsel readers to play the believing game to ascertain the truth of the story. Readers assuming this way of participating in the narrative experience of another must be prepared to see a story's possible meanings and, through this process, come to see other ways of  telling their own stories.

The correlates of graduate student participation in certain scholarly activities with the students' perceptions of their academic program are investigated along three dimensions: support for scholarship, curriculum, and faculty encouragement. The mediating effects of gender, race, area of concentration, and level of graduate study on such scholarly participation by graduate students are discussed. Data for the research came from a survey of recent graduates (N=738) from a school of education in a state-funded, regional, research university. The survey's goal was the assessment of  students' satisfaction with several dimensions of their student experiences. Results indicate women are apparently disadvantaged in comparison to their male counterparts when it comes to participation in scholarly activities as graduate students, even in the field of education where there are plenty of opportunities for women to earn the doctorate.

Several general themes include the following: flexibility and partnership; sharing and using the benefits of existing high technology in existing industries; and the role of government as a partner and enabler rather than regulator or sole service provider in the overall effort.

        "description":"A study exploring and clarifying the content domain of the concept of faculty scholarship is presented. Faculty scholarship is an area that has met with continued, uncoordinated, research interest in higher education. The study asked faculty participants to specify the qualities, attributes, and components of faculty scholarship from their own points of view by naming scholars from three reference groups and listing the reasons why they considered them scholarly. Interviews followed in which participants answered questions about the study conduct, their motivation in the study, the development of their conception of scholarship, and whether the data they provided conveyed the essence of their definition of faculty scholarship. The 40 attributes of faculty scholarship most  frequently used to describe nominees are listed, with the top few being: published articles; respect by peers across the disciplines; broad generalized knowledge beyond the field; contribution to, or influence on, the field through research; and sharing knowledge with others. Results show high levels of both faculty cooperation and a rich, expansive production of the components of faculty scholarship. The success of the data collection effort is without precedence in terms of faculty participation. Evidence shows the construct of faculty scholarship is even more complex than initially imagined. Two appendices are a form for exploring faculty scholarship and a questionnaire to determine attributes of scholarship. Contains 15 references. (SM)",

Objectives were to describe the characteristics of the offices, examine the characteristics and policies in relation to their success in obtaining federal and non-federal funding, and suggest models and successful approaches at large, mid-sized, and small institutions that could inform professional practice in this field. Data were obtained as part of the overall research/sponsored programs data collection activity, which used a six-part survey. Forty-six of 106 OFP institutions responded. The  survey asked for data on institutional demographics and grants office characteristics (such as office functions, organizational patterns, financial and personnel resources, and general institutional policies). Results indicate that, for these institutions, the characteristics most likely to promote success in obtaining federal funding involve direct and sustained commitment from institutional administrators and faculty. Though cultivation activations like data dissemination, assistance with proposal development, and recognition of faculty seeking funds are not significantly related to direct success, they are necessary as seed activities to enhance the research/grants seeking climate.

This collection of cases and readings on teaching with the case method in graduate professional programs and in the liberal arts is a statement of the rationale, methods, and recurring problems of the case method. It has much to say, also, about teaching and learning and about serious discourse concerning teaching and learning. Professors have invented many social conventions, such as the myth of academic freedom, to cover the lack of serious attention to teaching and learning. Direct scrutiny of a colleague's teaching is considered a violation of basic academic conduct. Another useful convention is the myth of the \"art\" of teaching. Sentimentalization of good teaching provides a way to recognize  those who think seriously about teaching without challenging those who don't. Christensen assumes that the principle \"how we teach is what we teach\" forms the basis for a critical and systematic view of teaching and learning, with teaching seen as the creation, in concert with students, of a model of critical thinking, understanding, and action informed by knowledge.

        "description":"One challenge in today's society is to teach students how to solve problems and use the general education they acquire to arrive at realistic solutions. Techniques that cut across the curriculum and can be used by any university teacher to provide realistic experiences for students are discussed. Students need the same acquired skills in technology and industry as are necessary for success in any professional field: communication and interpersonal skills, linked to problem solving skills. The techniques are clustered into the general categories of group dynamics (such as leadership, communication, presentation, and persuasion skills) and problem solving strategies (such as the design process, information management, and learning skills). An example of a process guide to problem  solving, borrowed from technology, is described. Its seven steps are: define the problem carefully; establish criteria for the solution; research possible solutions; brainstorm all manner of sensible and nonsensible potential solutions; narrow the acceptable or promising options and develop them; create a working model; and evaluate the end result. The role of the educator should be to provide the student with appropriate experiences for defining and solving problems. Contains 5 references. (SM)",

The four analysis objectives were to: examine aggregate state tax appropriations for higher education annually from 1969 to 1989 in the 50 states; analyze state tax appropriations in each state on a per capita basis; compare state tax appropriations per capita in current dollars and in constant dollars for 1977-78 and 1987-88; and analyze measures of elasticity for the 1969-79 decade, the 1979-89 decade, and the 20 years as a whole. Study results show the decade of the 1970s stands in marked contrast to the 1980s. It was characterized by remarkable growth in higher education. The 1980s were characterized by fiscal stringency and annual percentage gains which are closer to increases in  inflation. Over the 20-year period, there was an annual mean gain of 10.4% for the nation. Regional patterns, per capita appropriations, regional cost of living adjustments, elasticity measures, and explanations for changes in support (regional variations and the availability of revenue) are discussed. An Illinois case study is described that shows an inadequate level of state funding of higher education. Appended are a series of tables and graphs and calculations of elasticity measures.

It is noted that there is much in their educational regimen which militates against developing these habits of mind. It is hypothesized that much of this problem resides in the hidden cultural meanings of professionalism in general and that many of these hidden meanings remain unchallenged by educational curricula in development studies. Much can be done at the curricular level to suggest a notion of professionalism that encourages a thoroughgoing respect for alternate cultural viewpoints and the particular perspectives/aspirations of development professional's host community. The four parts of the presentation deal with the following topics: (1) professionalism as  a hazardous occupation (outlining some of the inherent paternalistic overtones associated with the concept of professionalism and ways that these are reinforced by higher education); (2) pedagogical considerations in development education (exploring some of the pedagogical dimensions involved in developing the skills of cultural sensitivity and listening within students); (3) cross-disciplinary experiments and Eastern College's (Pennsylvania) Master of Business Administration program in Economic Development (offering a brief account of how the school is trying to address these issues within a graduate program and problems that have been encountered so far); and (4) travel seminars and cultural understanding (focusing on a work/study seminar that was recently organized for Eastern College  students in Nicaragua).

Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) and its related Postsecondary Education Transcript Study conducted in 1984. Patterns of progress and attendance are shown for the 12-year period following high school. The two main topics addressed are: (1) the average time taken to complete each level of postsecondary education through a bachelor's degree; and (2) how many students take longer than normally expected to progress through  postsecondary education. Results indicate the following: expectations for the time to complete any level or year of PSE are shorter by 3 to 9 months than actually taken by 1972 high school seniors; men are more likely to take longer at each level than women; the longer students wait to start PSE after high school, the more likely they are to take extra time to complete the freshman year; and completion of each level within the expected time contributes to continuation through the next level of postsecondary education.

In addition to 8 days of structured observation, the study included semi-structured, in-depth interviews with the person being studied and two chairs from other departments along with time logs from 2 days when the subject of the study was working outside of the office. The subject was a chair of a Department of Educational  Administration and Supervision in a major research university. The study looked at the amount of time in minutes spent on five incidents (scheduled meetings, unscheduled meetings, phone calls, tours, and desk work). Results include the following: one of the main frustrations of academics who attempt to perform the administrative role is the very limited amount of uninterrupted desk work; time concerns weigh heavily on all department chairs; time spent in scheduled meetings is not usually rewarding to university department chairs; and 6% of their time is spent on phone calls.

Preclinical students and faculty from a private midwestern American medical school participated. Responses were gathered from one class of traditional curriculum students and from one class of  problem based learning students. Students were asked to indicate how often in the past year they had used each of the different study resources listed for them and to rate a series of educational activities by their effectiveness in helping them pass an exam and for preparing them to become good physicians. Results indicate a greater congruence between the goals of medical school and the development of physician-like behaviors, such as professional or self-directed learning, in a problem based curriculum than in a traditional curriculum.

        "description":"This document reports on a study of influences on the choice of family practice as a medical speciality in a setting in which primary care is not stressed. The study surveyed 392 alumni of the University of Michigan Medical School who graduated between 1950 and 1984 and were members of the American Academy of Family Physicians and/or were certified by the American Board of Family Practice; of these, 243 returned completed questionnaires for a response rate of 63%. Each eligible graduate received a questionnaire consisting of five sections and 40 questions. The questionnaire items included such topics as: year of graduation from medical school; post-graduate training; parents' occupations; practice profiles; time period during which decision to be a family physician was made; and  institutional influences on career choice. Results include the following: 16% of the family physicians surveyed had at least one physician parent; about 52% came from middle class families; most came from large and small hometowns with 36.9% growing up in major metropolitan areas or suburbs of a city larger than 50,000; and private physicians practicing in either solo or group practices comprised 73% of the respondents. The largest influences on specialty choice were found to be the opportunity to treat a variety of illnesses, know patients personally, and work with people as opposed to things. The medical school setting provided little support for the choice of family practice but offered an environment of high quality education and an opportunity to see a variety of illnesses.

        "description":"The higher education system in Israel is discussed, noting that tertiary education in that country makes a clear distinction between higher (university and academic) education and postsecondary education that is largely vocational. The Planning and Grants Committee (PGC) of the Council for Higher Education is responsible for the budgets of Israel's eight universities. Israel also has a group of specialized institutions of higher education which can only award the Bachelor's degree. They are under the aegis of the PGC. Six teacher training institutions are handled by a special permanent committee set up by the Council. Institutions that provide certain academic courses under the academic supervision of a university (e.g. regional colleges) are also found in Israel and financed by  the Ministry of Education and Culture and regional authorities. About 30% of all research and development in Israel is carried out in the universities. The PGC has become the most powerful and central organization in higher education as a result of a gradual withdrawal of the government from its direct involvement. In recent years universities have questioned the validity of the allocation methods employed by the PGC and have even protested against its decisions. The outcomes of the present inherent tension between autonomy and control remain to be seen. Tables are included. Contains 20 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Controversy over whether rising college costs or recent federal policies have adversely affected opportunities for postsecondary education, especially among low income and minority students, is noted. A study examined the competing claims that (1) there are enrollment increases among all students (even minorities) and (2) enrollment is far lower for low income and minority students than advantaged groups. Changes in enrollment and persistence for various types of students are described. The study saw the need for a clear analysis of trends in postsecondary education. It took the perspectives that: policy discussions about equity and opportunity must examine the progress of individual students over time; and studies of enrollment are a first step to documenting trends in  postsecondary education. Two major sections look at: (1) changes in postsecondary education (immediate enrollment after high school, cumulative enrollment in each year after high school graduation, and total enrollment after 4 years); and (2) changes in persistence in postsecondary education (immediate entry into postsecondary education and entry at four time periods). Each section concludes with a brief examination of multivariate models for enrollment and persistence. It was found that the record of the 1972-82 decade was mixed. The decade had a positive overall trend in postsecondary enrollment, with large increases for all groups between 1972 and 1980. Upward trends were particularly notable for women, minorities, and students of low socioeconomic status. In contrast to this general  picture, however, trends in persistence were downward for all types of students. A technical appendix is included. Figures and tables are included. (SM)",

        "description":"A background for discussion of curriculum reform and some concrete examples of what is occurring in parts of the United States are presented. The current debate over the undergraduate curriculum is reviewed, summarizing the criticisms and key recommendations of the most influential recent reports. State and institutional responses to these reports are reviewed, and key issues for faculty are discussed. Six sections deal with the following topics: context of the current debate; the critiques (i.e., there is no shared vision or purpose, there is poor intellectual integration, there is inadequate depth, and there is not enough attention paid to methods and styles of inquiry); causes of current problems (competition for students, new institutional priorities, and weaker standards);  proposed reforms (especially as contained in the Association of American Colleges and National Institute of Education reports); institutional and state responses; and issues for faculty (establishing curriculum priorities, protecting professional prerogatives, reassessing faculty reward systems, and ensuring adequate support for faculty). Seven conclusions include the following: faculty should insist on a primary role in curricular reform; faculty should work to see that good teaching is encouraged, recognized, and rewarded; and faculty should be vigilant in protecting the academic freedom of their colleagues. Two appendices discuss (1) the components of the undergraduate curriculum and (2) the NEA Policy Statement on Curricular Reform. Suggestions on further reading are provided,  including the Carnegie Foundation &quot;Trilogy&quot; on the curriculum, the reform reports, including Lynne Cheney's Humanities in America (1988) and a response to Cheney published by the American Council of Learned Societies.

Five teaching strategies were employed: demonstration, activity-based instruction, team-teaching, discussion, and lecture. The modifications necessary to adapt each strategy for use with the medium are reported. Observation of interactive television lessons has revealed the need for thorough pre-planning on behalf of the instructor and careful consideration of the means by which the medium may enhance the attainment of goals. It is hypothesized that teachers who teach via interactive television will show greater variety in the strategies they employ and increased  effectiveness as measured by changes in student learning outcomes and attitudes.

This phase of the project investigated the feasibility of a computer-based instruction (CBI) workstation, designed for use by teachers of handicapped students within a school structure. This station is to have as a major feature the ability to produce in-house full-motion video using one of the presently-available video recording devices, such as WORM (Write Once, Read Many) drives, LaserFilm, or interactive video tape. A systematic evaluation of video storage devices was carried out, and resulted in the identification of several acceptable devices around which such a workstation could be designed. Studies of user needs for characteristics of authoring and delivery systems were also undertaken. It was found that expert systems should be  incorporated into the design of the workstation to aid the teacher in designing CBI, and also to help in producing the instructional lessons. It was proposed that a new type of CBI be developed to enable the teacher to more easily design lessons structured in ways similar to the way the teacher would deliver the lesson in person.

The workshop addressed the major issues in developing effective technical trainers in the participating countries. The main body of the book incorporates resource papers presented and discussed in the workshop. Three subthemes provide the scheme by which the papers are classified. The first subtheme, Developing the Framework, includes papers that highlight the importance of linking training programs with other national development efforts. The second subtheme, Developing the  Systems, discusses principles and practices necessary to develop more effective training systems. Finally, the third and largest part of the book includes papers addressing the subtheme of Developing the Instruments. These papers discuss the various mechanisms successfully used in a number of countries to make the training effort significantly more effective. The last section of the book outlines conclusions and recommendations of the workshop relating to nine areas: (1) training policy; (2) training staff; (3) training curriculum; (4) training materials; (5) training approaches; (6) training standards; (7) training research; (8) regional cooperation; and (9) technical assistance.

        "description":"Apprehension about evaluating the use of computers in schools can be attributed to a variety of reasons, including the claim that evaluation discourages innovation and discovery. Powerful reasons, however, make evaluation at both regional and national levels desirable. By conceiving of evaluation as a formative, on-going process rather than as a summative process, it becomes possible to identify problems in a project from the start, allowing developers to take corrective action. Additionally, formative evaluation can provide generalizable data which may facilitate the implementation of similar projects elsewhere, thus reducing waste of time and money, an important consideration given the public's demand for accountability in education. Formative evaluation contributes to the  validation process by making possible the establishment of a broader base of information which can be utilized to more reliably chart change and growth in programs. In fact, it can be a positive, helpful activity rather than a negative, judgmental activity if provision is made for effective communication about the goals of evaluation with staff members; the process is open to the emergence of unanticipated questions and to the discussion of program shortcomings; an external evaluator is employed; a system of regular reporting to program staff is included; and system goals for the use of computers are periodically clarified with program staff. Evaluations incorporating these guidelines are unlikely to stifle the energy and enthusiasm that are so critical in the innovation process.  (GL)",

        "description":"A nationwide survey of over 3,000 grade 11 students (approximately equal numbers of males and females) representing major urban areas in all ten provinces was undertaken to obtain baseline data on access to and usage of computers in each of three categories--recreational, nonrecreational home usage, and school--and to test a &quot;manifold model&quot; of computer-student interaction in a Canadian context. The impact of gender differences and of usage category differences on the overall system of computer-related attitudes and actions was a particular focus of the study. Regardless of the use to which computers are put, or the location--home or school--in which computers are used, grade 11 females in this sample are less likely than males to be frequent computer users. From a theoretical  perspective the study supports a &quot;manifold model&quot; approach that represents the mutual interrelationships between various clusters of variables relevant to a young person's decision to make use of a computer, e.g., access, general and personal attitudes toward computers, social issues and values, computer self-perception, and use and user stereotypes. This model has considerable potential as a framework for subsequent refinements in the study of the relationships between Canadian adolescents and computers. (GL)",

        "description":"The effects of four methods of immediate corrective feedback delivered by computer within a question-based concept and rule learning setting were investigated in this study. A second purpose of the study was to probe the complex relationship between types of corrective feedback and the types of errors made by learners. One hundred and fifty-three students enrolled in an undergraduate biology class for nonmajors were randomly assigned to one of four immediate corrective feedback conditions commonly used in computer-based instructional situations. The types of errors made by learners during instruction were analyzed and compared across groups. Dependent variables were achievement on a retention test, feedback study time, on-task achievement, and feedback efficiency. An adaptive  design template, the rational set generator, was applied in the design and delivery of instruction. Results indicated the group which received simple knowledge-of-correct-results feedback used significantly less feedback study time and was more efficient than any other condition. Consistent with prior studies, the adaptive design strategy overcame differences in retention which may have been observed with an instructional strategy using a fixed number of interrogatory instances. Learners who made fewer fine discrimination errors during instruction, however, scored higher on a retention test. As expected, a significantly higher number of fine discrimination errors were made on the retention test. An important finding of this study is that almost twice as much feedback study time was  consumed for fine discrimination errors across all conditions. Results of data analyses are presented in 10 tables. (37 references) (Author/GL)",

        "description":"The incorporation of new technologies into elementary and secondary education must be initiated through reconceptualization of curriculum and instruction; expecting the technology alone to catalyze the transformation is unreasonable and not substantiated by experience. The traditional curriculum improvement process is the best vehicle for bringing computers and related devices--videodiscs, CD-ROM, telecommunications--into the schools. Alliances between curriculum improvement teams and technology resource specialists can best accomplish this desired integration, using a curriculum-driven rather than a technology-driven approach. In nearly every area curriculum improvement follows similar patterns: (1) content/process curriculum balance; (2) integration of learning/study skills;  (3) increased attention to thinking in problem-solving skills; and (4) an extended range of instructional strategies. The instructional unit plan is the device for supporting this integrated curriculum. Teachers develop integrated unit plans by blending six ingredients: (1) information and concepts; (2) process skills related to the discipline or subject; (3) thinking and reasoning skills; (4) learning and study skills; (5) technology application skills; and (6) communication skills. A form for an instructional unit plan outline is attached. (11 references) (GL)",

First, the economic status of the state is outlined, a rationale for the incorporation of technology into the schools is given, and the potential benefits of technology and its expected impact on teaching, learning, curriculum, management, and facilities are reviewed. Objectives and requirements are presented in tabular form for student workstations, teacher workstation modules, administrator  workstations, open-access learning centers, and telecommunications centers. An action plan for technology integration is then described which focuses on the priority areas of classroom instruction, instructional management, distance learning, and communications. Implementation of the plan is discussed in terms of hardware procurement and purchase, courseware adoption and provision, training and certification of teachers, instructional delivery systems, and research and development. Calendars are also provided for three phases of implementation--1988-89 through 1991-92; 1992-93 through 1995-96; and 1996-97 through 1999-2000.

The emphasis was on how the school library media specialist can use, adapt, or supplement the components of the media center to meet those needs. These components encompass a media program of services and instruction which make the facility, equipment, and collection accessible to the entire school community through the design and management of a professional media staff. To this end an operational model, guidelines, and assessment guide have been developed for use by media personnel in meeting the mandates of P.L. 94-142 (The Education for All Handicapped Children Act). These materials will be field-tested during Phase II of the project. An  extensive review of the literature was conducted which showed little in the way of field-tested, comprehensive materials on all aspects of a media program in relation to all handicapping conditions. The products of this project are designed to fill this gap. The major product of Phase I of the project is the manual entitled &quot;Mainstreaming in the Media Center: A Manual for Media Specialists.&quot; This manual, which is included in this report as Appendix A and makes up the major part of the document, consists of the operational model, the guidelines, and an assessment guide for use by school library media personnel in meeting the needs of mainstreamed handicapped students.

Secondary purposes include an evaluation of the &quot;media imperialism&quot; thesis as an explanation of the patterns of flow that can be observed; and an investigation of the validity of researchers' and politicians' claims that the United States dominates Western European television. The first of five chapters in the report describes the purposes of the study and provides a review of earlier research. The second chapter outlines the conceptual framework of  the study and describes transnationalization of supply and consumption of television broadcasting. Addressing the second major purpose of the study, the third chapter provides data on transnationalization of television in Europe. Discussions of the media imperialism thesis and both positive and negative effects of transnationalization are presented in the fifth chapter. The final chapter outlines policy and research implications of the study. The report includes 28 tables, an extensive list of references, and three appendixes which include a review of the empirical research on which the study is based and the absolute data from which the tables were derived.

The next section considers issues in the implementation of educational innovations: (1) how to involve the large group of non-using teachers in the integration of computers in the school's curricula; (2) how to integrate the computer into the formal curriculum, including evaluating the quality of educational software; (3) how to integrate computers into the operational curriculum, including teacher-learning activities such as selection of software and unanticipated problems with teachers'  existing instructional roles; and (4) relation to curriculum implementation from the teachers' perspective--e.g., instrumentality, congruence, and cost--and the innovation perspective--e.g., clarity, complexity, consensus and conflict, and quality and practicality of innovation products. The question of whether the computer is an adequate instructional medium is then considered by examining models of both the learning process and the instructional process. It is noted that within each instructional function the teacher can choose instructional methods and media from an array of combinations. A final section explores the issue of how to design educational software in such a way that a teacher will be able to use it in his/her operational curriculum in the way intended by the developer.

        "description":"Unfortunately, much of the research devoted to Logo and problem solving has not supported the claim that Logo provides an environment in which children will develop problem solving skills, but the literature suggests that direct instruction and mediated Logo programming practice can result in the acquisition and transfer of certain problem solving abilities. The research reported in this paper was designed to test such an hypothesis by differentiating between interventions combining direct instruction and mediated practice and discovery learning approaches, and with assessing the importance of programming within that model. Subjects were 100 students in the fourth through the sixth grades who had all had at least one year (30 hours) of prior experience programming in Logo. All  subjects were pretested on their ability to solve problems requiring the use of each of the five problem solving strategies under investigation, and randomly assigned by grade to one of three treatment conditions--a Logo graphics condition, a cut-paper manipulative condition, or a discovery learning, Logo projects condition. Results reveal that the model can indeed support the acquisition and transfer of four problem solving strategies--subgoals formation, forward chaining, systematic trial and error, and analogy--whereas neither discovery learning in a Logo environment nor direct instruction with concrete manipulatives practice can accomplish that. Indications are that the model can support the teaching and learning of alternative representation strategies as well. The findings support  claims for the efficacy of Logo as a medium conducive to the teaching and learning of problem solving, and argue for the use of knowledge-based instructional design and computing environments in the creation of problem solving interventions.

Thirteen CBI programs placed in 26 elementary and secondary schools throughout the New York City school system were evaluated during the 1987-88 school year. Results reveal that CBI programs can indeed be an effective means for delivering such instruction, that they can be as effective in providing instruction in reading as they are in providing mathematics instruction to educationally disadvantaged students, and that within that population an inverse relationship exists between instructional level and achievement gains resulting from involvement with CBI. The  differential effectiveness of differing programs was also suggested in the findings. Interviews with participating students and teachers indicate that four features of CBI make it particularly useful to educationally disadvantaged students-- CBI is perceived by students as less threatening than traditional classroom instruction, it provides extensive drill and practice exercises, it typically provides individualized diagnostics, and CBI programs provide students with greater academic support.

Of the 43 library users who completed the questionnaire, nearly half reported that they attempted to find paper copies of the ERIC microfiche documents before using the microfiche, and 51% of them also charged out a viewer, while  32% planned to use a viewer elsewhere, four intended to copy their documents on a reader-printer elsewhere, and three owned their own viewers. Searching ERIC on CD-ROM was the most cited source of references, followed by the library system's online catalog. Nearly all of the respondents felt that the process for gathering references and locating ERIC microfiche was simple and understandable, and two-thirds of them reported that the library policy was suitable for their purposes. Additional information on the library survey provided in this report includes loan periods and annual circulation rates for both microfiche and viewers; number of microfiche that can be charged out; user access to ERIC files; amounts of in-house equipment; and problems encountered. Copies of the two questionnaires  are appended. (BBM)",

        "description":"Conducted at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) to obtain a better understanding of the research environment in which graduate students function and their particular information needs, this study used a multi-methods approach which included analyses of library and graduate college data; interviews with graduate advisors of selected departments; a study of the syllabi of graduate courses; and a questionnaire sent to all graduate students (over 2,000). Examination of the data revealed that the graduate students at BGSU come from many different undergraduate institutions and are pursuing research in a wide range of subjects, many of them interdisciplinary. Most graduate students have to write at least one research paper each semester, and critical thinking, reading and writing  well, and the application of their studies to real world problems are expected in most of their programs. Although most students have had prior experience with library research, they encountered difficulties with many parts of the research process and both graduate students and faculty needed more information about the library services available to them at BGSU. The vast majority of the students work at least part time and report problems with both time management and access to materials. The latter could be partially alleviated if each department and campus office frequented by graduate students had a terminal set up to access the library's online catalog (LS/2). An integrated reference/bibliographic network would also greatly aid graduate students and faculty in their efforts to conduct  significant and timely research. Supporting data and a copy of the questionnaire are appended. (34 references) (BBM)",

Various types of security equipment are described in the third section, including locking systems,  security alarms, surveillance equipment, and guards. The pros and cons of each type of system are considered. Fire and water hazards are addressed in the fourth section, and criteria for evaluating fire protection are suggested. The fifth section discusses the legal aspects of the problem and suggests five questions that the administrator may wish to present to an attorney. A brief concluding statement in the sixth section reiterates the fact that, although electronic and legal tools are becoming available to archivists, the best security and surveillance systems are the diligence of staff members and the administrator's resolve to prosecute all crimes against the archives.

        "description":"This study sought to determine the levels of persistence in scanning postings that are typical of users of one online public information system, LCS (Library Computer System), as it was configured in Illinois in 1987. The study involved observation of users doing searches in an academic library, questioning them about what they had done, and then analyzing the system transaction log of those searches. The users' reports about their searches were then compared with the machine-recorded transcriptions of those searches. Major findings of the study include: (1) users reporting overload also reported finding a significantly smaller number of postings than other users and were likely to have experienced overload in the past, suggesting that they have information processing capacities  or search styles that inhibit their persistence; (2) the median number of postings considered to be &quot;too many&quot; by all of the users was 15; (3) more users whose searches retrieved between 15 and 30 postings displayed records of all postings than ceased searching without displaying any records; and (4) users' persistence falls off significantly when the number of postings exceeds more than 30. These findings suggest that surveying users about their preferences for the length of a list of references they are willing to scan on an online public information system will underestimate their persistence in actually scanning lists of references. They also suggest that system designers may defer providing help for users in coping with large number of postings until that number reaches 30. A copy of  the user questionnaire is appended.

The primary objectives of the survey were to determine the students' educational and career achievements subsequent to attending HCC and to assess the effectiveness of the college from the students' perspective. All other Maryland community colleges fielded the same questionnaire to their students, allowing for comparisons among peer institutions. Questionnaires were mailed to all 1,160 first-time students who entered HCC in fall 1984.

Study findings included the following: (1) when asked about the most important reason they attended HCC, 31.8%  of the respondents listed \"transfer to a four-year institution,\" 16.2% listed \"update skills for current job,\" 14.5% listed \"self-enrichment/courses of interest only,\" 10.6% listed \"prepare for entry into different career,\" and 7.8% listed \"prepare for entry into first career\"; (2) 70% of the respondents attended part time; (3) 36.5% of the respondents indicated that their initial educational goal had been to take selected courses, without intending to complete a degree, while 35.4% planned to earn an associate degree; (4) 60.6% indicated that they had been very successful in attaining their goal, and 85.4% felt that the courses they had taken at HCC had helped them achieve their goal; (5) the majority of the respondents gave ratings of \"good\" or \"very good\" to their college experiences;  (6) almost 45% of the respondents started their current job after leaving HCC; and (7) in comparison with students at peer colleges, more HCC students entered with college degrees, attended part time, and lost some credits in transfer, while fewer HCC students initially set out to earn an associate degree or certificate.

        "description":"A year after graduation, a survey was attempted by the Massachusetts Board of Regents of all 1981-82 career graduates of public community colleges in the state (N=5,267). Of the 1,881 responding graduates, 847 reported that they were employed full-time, and 737 of the working graduates gave the board permission to contact their employers for an assessment of their performance. The employers of the 737 graduates were surveyed using the Employer Follow-Up (EFU) questionnaire developed as part of the Vocational Education Data System (VEDS). Study findings, based on a 79.8% response rate, included the following: (1) overall, the graduates were rated between good and very good by their employers with respect to technical knowledge, work attitudes, work quality, technical skills,  overall quality, and relative preparation, as compared to co-workers who graduated from similar programs; (2) graduates were rated lowest on technical skills and technical knowledge; (3) graduates who were working full time in their area of training were rated significantly higher on technical knowledge and overall quality than graduates working in areas not related to their training; (4) Technology and Human Services graduates working in a field related to their training received higher ratings than other graduates, with Medical/Health Science graduates having the lowest average ratings; and (5) overall, males and females received similar performance ratings, though males had significantly higher average wages than females. Comments on the labor- and time-intensive character of the EFU  are included. (ALB)",

        "description":"In September 1984, a Vocational Education Data System (VEDS) follow-up survey was conducted of all 5,267 students who had graduated from Massachusetts public community colleges in 1982-83. Of these graduates, 1,881 (35.7%) returned the survey, and 3,386 (64.3%) did not. A subsequent study was conducted to compare the characteristics of survey respondents and non-respondents. A random sample of 380 of the non-respondents was drawn, and telephone interviews were completed with 201 individuals. The interviews focused on graduates' reasons for not returning the VEDS questionnaire; the degree and program they had pursued; their sex, age, ethnic background, and location of college; their evaluation of their academic program and job preparation; their employment and educational status;  the relationship between their job and education; and their salary. Study findings included the following: (1) the most common reason for not completing the mailed survey was that it was never received; (2) no significant differences were found between the VEDS respondents and non-respondents in terms of degree pursued, program, sex, ethnic origin, ratings of academic training or quality of occupational preparation, or employment or educational status; (3) 12% of the non-respondents identified themselves as economically disadvantaged or as having other special needs, compared to 2.6% of the respondents; and (4) non-respondents had significantly higher average wages than respondents, especially among graduates working in a field related to their training. Based on study findings, it was  concluded that, if biased, the VEDS was biased in the direction of under-estimation of outcomes rather than over-estimation. Twenty-three tables are included. (AYC)",

Transfer centers were established at 20 California community colleges. Working closely with counterparts at eight University of California (UC) campuses, 14 California State University (CSU) campuses, and 13 independent colleges, transfer center staff provide academic advising and counseling to students preparing for transfer, articulation information for specific universities and majors, information on admissions requirements, and transcript evaluations. Transfer centers also make outreach efforts to address the needs of ethnic minority  students, students with disabilities, and students from other underrepresented groups. This report on the Transfer Center Project contains: (1) a project description, including information on center goals and operations; (2) findings and recommendations from an external evaluation of the project with respect to implementation and attainment of goals, cooperative efforts between the community colleges and CSU and UC systems, a 32% increase in the number of fall-term transfers to UC campuses, and an 8% increase in transfers to CSU campuses involved in the project; (3) a list of activities to be undertaken by the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to further promote transfer; (4) lists of the Transfer Center Project colleges and advisory committee members; and (5)  the executive summary of the project evaluation.

        "description":"The current official policy of the California community colleges on grading prohibits the use of plus and minus symbols to modify a standard letter grade. Plus and minus grades may influence a student's grade point average (GPA) either through statistical effects or psychological effects on teachers and students. At its fall 1985 session, and again in fall 1987, the Academic Senate for the California Community Colleges requested that districts be permitted to decide upon whether to use the plus and minus symbols. The implementation of such a policy would require that the following issues be resolved: (1) some argue that there should be a uniform grading policy among all community colleges, while others argue for local discretion; (2) assigning a numerical value of 0.3 to pluses  and minuses would work to the benefit of transfer students from districts that use the plus/minus designation; and (3) there are various ways that a minus grade could be treated in regard to &quot;satisfactory completion&quot; of course requirements, leading to problems of equity for students from different community colleges and between community colleges and transfer institutions. This report to the Board of Governors includes an analysis of the issue of &quot;satisfactory completion&quot; of courses and recommended revisions to the California Code of Regulations to implement a permissive use of pluses and minuses by districts.

        "description":"Listening is a skill that permeates all curriculum areas at both elementary and secondary levels. Definite philosophies are in evidence pertaining to listening. The testing and measurement movement has stressed using precise, behaviorally stated objectives in teaching-learning situations. Learning opportunities are selected which harmonize with predetermined strategies in the area of listening. The evaluation procedure is matched to the specific learning goals. As a second philosophy of teaching, students with teacher guidance may engage in problem solving experiences. Listening activities can be an important way for students to secure information to solve problems. A third philosophy of teaching, individual decision making, stresses students as the focal point of making choices  in the curriculum. The behaviorally stated objectives movement advocates setting behavioral objectives for students to attain. Thus, a teacher, after teaching toward a set of behaviorally stated objectives in listening appraises the extent to which objectives have been attained. Finally, humanism as a psychology of learning emphasizes heavy student input into curriculum development. Content is selected for its intrinsic values of interest, meaning, and purpose for the student. In developing a listening curriculum, ample emphasis should be placed upon the problem solving, as well as the decision-making philosophies. More emphasis should also be placed upon humanism, as compared to the utilization of behaviorally stated objectives. Humanism, which stresses student initiative in the  curriculum, allows active student involvement in selecting and solving problems. (MM)",

Intended for undergraduates, the two programs were developed at Indiana University's Learning Skills Center, and were designed to teach students how to: (1) identify key concepts; (2) compare, contrast, and connect ideas by writing linking summary statements; and (3) synthesize and graphically map relationships among key concepts. Subjects, 205 undergraduate students of matched ability from a major university and from a two-year community college, were assigned to treatment and control groups, and read two 7-10 page textbook selections with topics, text formats, and difficulty levels typical of most  college level introductory texts in biology and psychology. The instructional format included explication of concepts, modeling of strategies, practice and feedback, and assessment and branching. Students who used the interactive computer programs significantly outperformed control group students; the fact that this pattern held in a test administered a week later which involved reading new texts without aid of the computer programs suggested successful transfer of the reading strategies. Interview and questionnaire data indicated that students viewed computer instruction positively. (Six tables of data are included, and 25 references are attached.) (SR)",

The survey found that overrepresented population groups of recreational readers include women, the college-educated, whites, the more affluent, and the middle-aged. Underrepresented groups include men, those with less than a high school education, Blacks and Hispanics, those with low incomes, and the elderly. The  survey used data from the publishing industry to find that the bulk of literature read by Americans consists of popular, genre fiction, that fewer than 25% of the people read quality literature, and that about 10% read the works of serious contemporary authors. The final section of the survey discusses possible reasons why the reading of literature is not more widespread and offers suggestions as to how research findings might be used to promote works of high-quality literature more effectively.

These methods include: testing and measuring; subject matter approaches; student decision-making and the affective dimension; and problem solving procedures. With testing and measuring methods, measurably stated objectives are predetermined for student achievement in reading. After instruction, the reading teacher measures whether students have been successful in goal attainment. In the subject matter approach, the teacher is concerned about the amount and quality of facts, concepts, and generalizations acquired by students. In the student-decision making and affective dimension perspective, students must make responsible decisions in selecting sequential reading material. Quality attitudes  are inherent as students choose books based on personal interests. Finally, problem solving procedures emphasize reading as a means to solve vital personal and societal problems. Of these approaches, problem solving methods should be given major attention in the teaching of reading. (MM)",

Twelve LD and 12 NLD subjects were randomly selected from grades 4-5, 7-8, and 10-11 in a southwestern Florida school district. In the first task, subjects gave an oral retelling of &quot;Judy's Birthday,&quot; a story used in a previous study. For the second task, a creative writing task, a story starter was selected from another story grammar study. For the first task, protocol scoring consisted of parsing and categorizing 25 propositions for &quot;Judy's Birthday,&quot; and identifying the intercategory, intracategory, and single statement reversals, as well as the  substitutions, additions, and deletions of material. Scoring procedures for the second task consisted of simply parsing and categorizing the story propositions. Analysis revealed that for both tasks, there were no developmental differences in relation to either story comprehension or production. However, there were significant differences between LD and NLD students in the amount and type of information included in the retellings and written stories. Results suggested that LD students had acquired a rudimentary but not fully developed schema for narrative prose. (Author/MM)",

The report finds a widespread tendency for medical students to develop significant errors in conceptual understanding, including specific conceptual misunderstandings and maladaptive biases in the thought processes used in dealing with complex concepts. The report notes particularly the tendency for misconceptions to compound each other within a general climate of oversimplification, producing large areas of  entrenched misunderstanding.

In this paper some of the special characteristics of advanced learning of complex conceptual material are discussed. The paper notes that these characteristics are often at odds with the goals and tactics of introductory instruction and with psychological biases in learning. The paper alludes to research in biomedical cognition that has revealed a substantial incidence of misconception attributable to various forms of oversimplification and outlines the factors that contribute to suboptimal learning at the advanced stage. A sketch of a theoretical orientation for more successful advanced knowledge acquisition in ill-structured domains, Cognitive  Flexibility Theory, is then presented. This orientation emphasizes: the use of multiple mental and pedagogical representations; the promotion of multiple alternative systems of linkage among knowledge elements; the promotion of schema assembly (as opposed to the retrieval of prepackaged schemas); the centrality of &quot;cases of application&quot; as a vehicle for engendering functional conceptual understanding; and the need for participatory learning, tutorial guidance, and adjunct support for aiding the management of complexity. The paper also discusses a computer hypertext approach that implements Cognitive Flexibility Theory. (Fifteen references are attached.) (Author/RAE)",

Subjects were asked how they were learning, how they tried to read a picture-phrase book, and how they wrote or drew pictures in response to requests to write something. Results indicated that most children were aware of how they were learning; they pretended to read by labeling pictures in the book they were given to read; they usually drew pictures or wrote single letters for the writing task, and they produced meaningful descriptions of their writings or drawings. Variations in the  subjects' literacy awareness were related to the instruction provided in school and the quality of home support for literacy.

The paper analyzes some of the general statements made in the report and focuses in depth on three issues: motivation and reading, comprehension instruction, and emergent literacy. The paper argues that although &quot;Becoming a Nation of Readers&quot; has been hailed as the definitive statement about reading, some of the key issues are buttressed by less than conclusive evidence.

A pilot study indicated that even preschool children appear capable of using the information provided by the linguistic and situational context to make inferences about the meaning of metaphorical sentences. The paper also argues that there is some evidence suggesting that young children can profit more from a situational context than a linguistic context in interpreting metaphors and that reliance on the situational and linguistic context decreases with increases in the knowledge base. Further research could substantiate these findings and investigate the mechanisms by  which children make use of contextual information to construct the meaning of a metaphorical linguistic input.

These verbal reports of individuals' thinking on draft items of multiple-choice critical thinking tests can be used systematically to provide evidence of the thinking processes elicited by such tests, and in this case were used to develop and validate a test of observation appraisal. The procedure included the following steps: (1) devising ideal models of thinking for each item; (2) developing a method for interviewing subjects; (3) collecting verbal reports of thinking from samples of subjects; (4) using the ideal models to rate the quality of the thinking portrayed in the reports; (5) comparing the quality of thinking to answer choices and  accumulating those comparisons across subjects for each item; and (6) identifying and modifying suspect items. The methodology cited in the report is offered as a way to gather evidence on the truth of claims that currently available multiple-choice critical thinking tests do not measure critical thinking, and as a way to develop new critical thinking tests.

This is partly because the Japanese written language makes initial learning easier and later learning more difficult. In addition, bolstered by a long history of literacy, Japanese parents provide more uniform support for their children's academic progress than do parents in the United States. From classroom observations and discussions with school principals and teachers about their programs and their instructional goals, it is apparent that Japanese kindergarten programs feature social development and cooperative group activity rather than academic skills. Finally, unlike reading instruction in American classrooms, Japanese primary grade classrooms are organized for whole class  reading lessons and are paced slowly to emphasize reading fluency and deep interpretation of text information.

Ninety-five students from a large midwestern university identified stem words, matched for length and individual frequency, which differed substantially in the frequency of their inflectional, derivational, and nonmorphological relatives. The frequency of inflectionally and derivationally related words significantly affected speed and accuracy of recognition of stems. However, the effects were conditioned by age of acquisition and part of speech. Taken as a whole, the results supported the concept of a word family, that is, the hypothesis that morphological  relationships among words, derivational as well as inflectional, are represented in the lexicon.

The papers were rated by 21 state conference participants. Raters were in-service language arts or reading teachers, with teaching experience ranging from 5 to 20 years. All raters had participated in a Colorado Writing Assessment Project, and had prior training and experience with holistic rating of essays. Each rater received a packet including a copy of one of seven scales, 30 papers for rating, and training notes. Each of the 30 papers was read three times for each of the seven scales. Bamberg's scale for coherency  was the dependent variable. Six scales, the independent variables of coherence, consisted of: cohesion; context; focus; grammar; intent; and structure. Results indicated interdependency between intent, focus, structure, and context. Intent was a significantly stronger predictor of text coherency than was cohesion or grammar. Results also indicated that if the variables of intent, structure, focus, and cohesion were highly present in a text, then a lack of grammar and context did not greatly affect the text's coherency level. It was further demonstrated that an author's apparent intent in writing a text was a strong predictor for the coherency of the text. (Three tables of data are included.) (MM)",

Hirsch, Jr.) plays in the nation's literacy, a study conducted an electronic search of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to establish the frequency of occurrence for a sample from the list. A random sample of 424 terms (9% of the total list) was selected. Each term or expression which was searched produced a figure representing the frequency of occurrence in the &quot;Times&quot; over a period of 101 months (June 1, 1980 to October 28, 1988), representing a corpus of 660.5 million words. Four frequency periods--yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily--were devised based on how often, on average, a term might be expected to turn up in the newspaper. The terms were also divided into eight categories: geography;  history; idioms/proverbs; literature/arts; math/sciences; politics/economics; psychology/anthropology; and religion. Results indicated that any given day's issue of the &quot;Times&quot; contained approximately 2,700 occurrences of terms from the list, with a few of them (such as &quot;New York&quot;) making up a good proportion of this number. Geography, the arts, and politics/economics dominated the frequency levels, while history and proverbs/idiomatic expressions were not high frequency categories. Results suggest that Hirsch has identified a corpus of cultural terms which play a part in the daily commerce of the published language.

Instructional management systems (or mastery learning) with their measurable objectives should be compared with holistic philosophies in reading instruction. A holistic approach to reading instruction should be implemented. Reading involves understanding sentences, paragraphs, and larger bodies of knowledge. Dividing skills into precise objectives for learners to attain violates what the actual act of reading is about. Quality research in reading must be refined and emphasized. At present, research results are confusing. Much negative research has been conducted and has little worth. Improved methods of conducting research must be emphasized. A study of the  philosophy of education is very helpful in determining objectives, learning opportunities, and appraisal procedures. Perhaps, achieving a quality of philosophy of teaching reading is more valuable them conducting and using research results.

Trained observers recorded the play behavior of each of 50 children (the average age was 4 years) during four 10-minute periods over 2 months, yielding 200 play protocols. Conent analysis of these protocols yielded five categories of literacy functions which appear to be common across different groups of preschoolers (exploratory, interactional, personal, authenticating, and transactional functions) and three broad categories of features of literacy demonstrations (awareness of text messages, awareness of symbolic representation, awareness of the  conventions of print). Results indicated that preschoolers appear to use literacy in ways that are meaningful to them, and that they develop conscious knowledge about the forms and functions of written language at a very young age. Moreover, results highlighted the intimacy between form and function, with features of written language apparently layered in written language functions and appearing as the function unfolds.

        "description":"A study is in progress (with posttesting planned for April 1989), which examines whether word processing enhances the particular benefits of sentence-combining practice on the reading comprehension and writing fluency of low-achieving intermediate students. Subjects are 80 low-achieving fourth grade students from a Florida school district, randomly assigned to one of three levels of treatment. The first experimental treatment group is participating in teacher-directed lessons on sentence-combining with independent practice on data files with a word processing program. The second experimental treatment group is receiving the same lessons and exercises, but the independent practice is on worksheets. A control group forms the third group. A clinical study component entails a more  in-depth analysis of students' writing and oral retellings of stories. Results will be collected from reading and writing measures, to include written retellings of stories using silent film prompts, two cloze tests, and audiotapes of story retellings. The clinical study component will be reported by means of narrative descriptions and descriptive statistics. The hypotheses for this research predict that the two experimental treatment groups will score significantly higher than the control group in writing fluency. (One table, of types of data to be collected and the manner in which it will be reported, is included. Twenty-two references are attached.) (SR)",

        "description":"Meaning and knowledge are separate constructs. Meaning is an idiosyncratic, cognitive construct; knowledge is a social construct built upon various shared meanings that are reconstructed and judged to be accurate or probable by a particular community. Language is the medium through which both meaning and knowledge are formed. Instructors can better prepare the developmental student for academic success if they (1) understand the epistemological role that language (particularly writing and reading) plays in the making of meaning and the construction of knowledge; (2) understand, and act upon, the distinctions between meaning and knowledge; and (3) engage the student in verbal behavior that fosters the construction of meaning and knowledge. There is a theoretical base for making  language (and its study) the essential agent in the generation of thought and meaning and also the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of knowledge construction and reification. There are also strategies that can be used to engage students (and instructors) in the creation of meaning and the negotiation of knowledge, such as calling up relevant prior knowledge, constructing relationships among parts of the whole, and monitoring and revising understanding--all essential to making meaning. These epistemological uses of language can empower developmental students to become early and full participants in the academic community. (Two figures are included, and 62 references are appended.)

        "author":["Ortiz, Joseph"],
        "description":"Effective instructional approaches for dealing with stage fright can be developed by examining A. H. Buss's theory of audience anxiety. Buss argues that audience anxiety correlates with feelings of self-consciousness, characteristics of the audience, and the novelty of the speaking role. From his perspective, the experience of anxiety is divided into three time intervals: (1) evaluation anxiety, occurring days to moments before the event; (2) self-consciousness, occurring in the first one or two minutes of the presentation; and (3) awareness of the novelty of the situation when viewing the audience from a speaker's perspective. This theory is useful in three ways. First, it presents a framework for helping students to understand the experience of fear in the public speaking  arena. Second, the theory helps to organize and place into a larger context some of the strategies that are often suggested for minimizing stage fright. Finally, the theory suggests some instructional strategies that instructors can use in teaching the public speaking course. These strategies include situational analysis, visualization strategies, and relaxation techniques. These approaches are most useful for the &quot;normal presenter,&quot; that is, the public speaker who experiences nervousness but is not dysfunctional and/or cross-situational. (Appendixes consist of structured and unstructured demonstration speech assignments and common textbook suggestions of ways to reduce stage fright. Sixteen references are also attached.) (MM)",

To communicate effectively, students need to utilize stress, pitch, and juncture appropriately in oral and written discourse. A stimulating class environment will provide a variety of learning opportunities. Audio-visual materials may be used to introduce students to the use of stress in written discourse, after which students, working in committees, may practice stressing words differently within a sentence, and discuss how this changes meaning. Finally, students may read aloud to each other, using diverse patterns of stress. The concept of pitch may be  introduced by demonstration on musical instruments, and with examples of varying spoken pitches, as in recordings of poets reading their work. Pitch should be emphasized as a tool for communicating ideas and content to others. Juncture emphasizes brief pauses within a word, as well as pauses between words. The teacher may read aloud various sentences without appropriate juncture and discuss with students why these sentences fail to communicate adequately. (Fifteen references are attached.) (SR)",

Cooperative learning is one of the most thoroughly researched strategies available to educators. Studies have consistently found that cooperative learning promotes increased academic achievement and can be implemented relatively easily and at reasonable cost. Improved behavior, increased liking of class, and better attendance are also benefits of cooperative learning strategies. Cooperative learning should be of particular interest to teachers of middle school children because, in addition to the highly desired outcomes described, cooperative learning enhances student motivation by providing peer support for students. It also encourages group  processes and positive social and academic interaction among students, and rewards successful group participation. By encouraging positive student interaction and building group skills, teachers can positively increase the academic success and self-esteem of their students.

Subjects, training directors of the five hospitals, were interviewed and given a brief background of why the study was being conducted. Results demonstrated that communication training programs do exist and that the programs are evaluated in some way. However, in no cases that were discussed, were measurements used to establish baselines before and after training to determine how they affect the organization's overall goals. Therefore, it seems clear that much more investigation and research is needed to determine if baselines can be constructed, and if training programs can be accurately assessed using this type of evaluation.

        "description":"The work of British playwright Sarah Daniels is some of the most politically provocative on the contemporary British stage. The uproar over Daniels' work comes not only because she argues for social change, but also because she offers models for building a new order. Two plays, with their comedy and their radical separatist politics, are representative of Daniels' feminist vision. The first play, &quot;Ripen Our Darkness&quot; (1981), demonstrates Daniels' use of anarchic narrative--non-male, non-linear--and her strategic use of the surreal. A fragment of the play's pre-production history is suggestive of both the threatening politics of the play and women's continuing battle to use the theater as their own political arena. The second play, &quot;Byrthrite&quot; (1987), shows Daniels' attention to  sexuality and language. Samples of the play's negative critical reception fault its narration, its characterization, or its language, when actually, it appears to be its politics which offend.

It hypothesized that increased exposure or attention to news about countries would covary with increased differentiation in such attitudes. It also hypothesized that knowledge about countries would act as a mediator variable that would largely account for any association between exposure and attitudinal variability. The hypotheses were examined with survey data from Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Subjects, 374 adult residents of Tuscaloosa County, were interviewed by telephone during middle and late November 1984. Partial correlation analyses suggested that regular readership of cosmopolitan newspapers and  newsmagazines may increase differentiation in a person's attitudes toward six countries: Great Britain, India, Japan, Mexico, the Soviet Union, and Venezuela. As predicted, the introduction of a control for knowledge about these countries reduced the association below the criterion for statistical significance. Analysis of the association of demographic control variables with differentiation suggested that factors other than knowledge also may affect the variability of a person's attitudes about countries.

Instead, researchers can more profitably view such effects as resulting from synthesized stimuli, of which media content is only one component. Thus, these phenomena should be called media-related effects, rather than media effects. Contextualism also implies a pluralism of both method and theory. In this regard both standardized and unstandardized indicators of the relationships among variables are needed to assess the importance of evidence concerning a media-related effect. More specifically, the routine reporting and interpretation of unstandardized indicators in nonexperimental research potentially could allow researchers to  make a much stronger case for the theoretical or practical importance of effects than is possible at present.

After an introductory discussion of why parents should choose their child's school, an overview is provided of the kinds of schools available: neighborhood public schools, public \"schools of choice\" (magnet schools), other public schools, and parochial or private schools. The middle section of the paper provides advice on each of four steps in choosing a school: (1) thinking about the child in relation to the family and community; (2) collecting  information on available schools; (3) visiting a school; and (4) gaining admission for a child into a selected private or public school. Subsequent chapters address when to think about changing schools again and what to do if there are no good schools.

This study describes and compares the goals, means, and outcomes of administrative reforms in the public educational systems of three Hispanic nations (Venezuela, Colombia, and Spain). All three countries executed decentralization and regionalization reform strategies with common characteristics that either facilitated or detracted from the proposed changes. A field research methodology was used to gather data from classroom teachers and ministers of education. A decade after decentralization efforts began, Spain and Colombia had demonstrated considerable success toward achieving their goals, while Venezuela had not.  There are eight principal reasons for this situation related to (1) differences in collaboration methods; (2) political party politics; (3) incremental approaches; (4) government continuity; (5) costs; (6) budget control; (7) regional boundaries; and (8) formalization of educational organization and management structures. Spain and Colombia's practice of decentralizing in stages allowed more experimentation leeway than Venezuela's &quot;all at once&quot; strategy, which proved difficult to integrate.

Study data had been obtained from an earlier comprehensive survey of 622 incumbent and aspiring Pennsylvania administrators. That study explored five areas: career pathways, job search strategies, time usage, mentors and their functions, and barriers experienced with strategies to overcome them. The present study, which did not include aspirants, focused on line versus staff career patterns, the use of leaves, the number of moves among districts, degrees obtained, age at beginning administrative positions, and family characteristics. A majority of  respondents pursued a line career path, with men (71 percent) more likely than women (52 percent) to have one. For both the superintendency and the elementary principalship, line paths were followed by men (82 percent) and women (54 percent). Both genders used line paths to reach the secondary principalship. For the assistant superintendency, women followed a staff path (73 percent) and men a line path (54 percent). Results for leaves, district moves, length of teaching service, and age and family characteristics are also discussed.

        "description":"This study investigated the effects of Teachers Teaching Teachers, a staff development project employing peer coaching methods, on public school educators' attitudes and beliefs. The 6-month project involved 13 teachers, administrators, and other school personnel in the Southeast Dubois County School Corporation (Ferdinand, Indiana). All participants were pretested and posttested on Likert Bipolar Attitude Inventories and Osgood's Semantic Differential Scales designed to measure desirable teacher characteristics. Similar measures were also administered to elementary and secondary students being taught by participating teachers. Results indicated that the mean scores for seven of the nine desired outcomes increased during the project. Significant differences were found for the  teachers' perceptions of other persons, attitude toward administrators, and attitude toward differentiated staffing. Two pretest measures were higher than the posttest measures, but these differences were not significant. Significant differences favoring the posttest were found for the elementary and secondary students' perceptions of their teachers' effectiveness. Overall, the results support the effectiveness of Teachers Teaching Teachers as a technique for enhancing positive educator attitudes and beliefs. Included are 22 references and 2 appendices containing summary statistics and measuring instruments used in the study. (MLH)",

        "description":"A survey of 622 aspiring and incumbent school administrators was conducted in order to document job search strategies used by men and women seeking principalships and superintendent or assistant superintendent positions. Since these positions are predominantly held by men, it has been suggested that men's and women's job search strategies differ in effort and technique. Results belie such views. Although younger respondents needed greater effort to obtain their first administrator job, age differences were not so great as expected. Those seeking or possessing a doctorate submitted more job applications, had more interviews, and used more job search strategies that those lacking doctorates. Aspirants made greater efforts than incumbents to obtain their first job; incumbents made  more efforts than aspirants to obtain the present job. To obtain administrative jobs, women submitted more applications, had more interviews, and searched longer than men. Female incumbent superintendents made much greater efforts than males, using 13 different search strategies whereas men used only 7. Basically, women employ more strategies to overcome barriers to administrative advancement than men do. Hence it cannot fairly be said that women are just not trying hard enough; blame for women's underrepresentation in educational administration needs to be assigned elsewhere, and monitoring for gender equity seems mandatory. Other implications and policy recommendations are provided. Included are 11 references and 7 tables. (MLH)",

The task force of teachers, principals, and local system administrators collected information from interviews with department of education program personnel; paperwork surveys; and data from school superintendents, educational organizations, and teachers. After an introduction, acknowledgements, and a review of background information, specific recommendations are presented for 25 issues related to provisions of the QBE. Specific recommendations include streamlining  attendance reporting by eliminating the requirement to maintain state attendance registers and reducing from three to two the number of times full-time equivalency counts are taken during the school year. Several recommendations relate to the implementation of the statewide electronic information network (GENESIS) called for by QBE. Other recommendations relate to substituting criterion-referenced for norm-referenced student testing programs; reevaluating the remedial education program; reviewing the student support team concept; and standards documentation. Appended is the following documentation: membership of the task force, list of Department of Education presenters, paperwork survey of experienced teachers, list of meetings of the task force, and a compilation of paperwork required  of teachers in one Georgia K-7 elementary school.

        "description":"Recent educational literature has stressed the benefits of site-based management and parental involvement in school programs. To capitalize on these benefits, site-based planning teams designed to involve perents, teachers, administrators, students, and community members were developed by the Institute for the Development of Educational Activities and piloted in nine Oklahoma City schools. The plan involved participants in a five-stage school improvement cycle (readiness, planning, training, implementing, and maintaining). During 1986-87, eight local schools began organizing site-based planning teams. To determine how these teams were functioning, two group facilitators at each site were interviewed. At that time, the schools were in various stages of program development. Even  though the cycle had not been completed, school improvements, such as better school climate, were already occurring at each site. Also, most schools had increased parental and/or community support. Some implementation difficulties were reported, such as afterschool overtime to carry out group charges, maintaining an active planning team after a principal was changed, and keeping community and business representatives on the teams. However, as benefits seemed to outweigh the costs, continued support for the site-based school improvement planning teams was recommended. Included are one table and seven references. (MLH)",

        "description":"Research studies investigating group differences in academic achievement consistently document lower scores for blacks than for whites, who typically score about one standard deviation above their black counterparts. Many controversial explanations for black achievement deficits have been advanced, ranging from cultural deprivation to inferior schooling. Focusing more on educational than cultural differences and using National Assessment of Educational Progress data, this study investigates a sample of 661 black eighth graders scoring above the national average in reading proficiency. In separate comparisons with other groups (the black population scoring below the national average in reading achievement and a sample of white high-achieving students), school characteristics and  student academic behaviors were identified that partly explain black-white achievement differences. High-achieving black students resemble their white counterparts in amount of reading, homework, and television watching; however, these students are as likely as their black counterparts to attend schools with high proportions of minority and poor students, although black high-achievers' family socioeconomic status is about midway between that of the two comparison groups.

The paper takes issue with moral imagination as a guide for effective leadership. Rather, it favors such leadership influences as &quot;critical imagination&quot; and &quot;democratic value deliberation.&quot; Critical imagination is the notion that managers exercise great caution and reflection when determining policies and goals. Democratic value deliberation is the idea that a school leader's private moral vision should be  made public. Once this is done, school and district educational leaders should arrange and engage in participatory and consensual decision-making processes with all constituencies rather than act independently.

The research methodology utilized the nonequivalent control group pretest/postest design. Multivariate analysis tested all variables. A covariant and a pretest mean score was also included in the analysis  of data. The findings of this study were consistent with most past research, which indicates no significant differences exist between alternative and traditional students' performance in acheivement except that males performed better in science. Findings on attitudes toward school subjects were consistent with prior research indicating that gender is a better predictor of attitude than participation in alternative school programs.

However, while pushing remedial education and job placement for adults, we may be losing a whole generation of children whose failure in school dooms them to repeat the dependency cycle. An alarming number of youngsters are poor, have a chaotic family life, and face situations putting them at risk of long-term disadvantage and a bleak future. Although education has traditionally offered an escape hatch from poverty and disadvantage, the present system is inadequate to help such children. Many youth are dropping out; others are leaving school without basic job-holding skills. The National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) is undertaking a multifaceted effort, called Joining  Forces, to develop joint strategies for successfully serving high risk youngsters and to promote these strategies' adoption by education and social welfare systems throughout the United States to help children break or avoid the welfare cycle, Joining Forces seeks to help (1) disadvantaged and high risk families better support their children's educational performance; and (2) schools improve these children's academic performance and likelihood of graduating from high school. Joining Forces will help schools and human services agencies with early intervention, family-school involvement programs, early response to children experiencing problems, and necessary policy changes. By working together or in tandem, the education and social welfare systems can make better use of limited resources  and give each system and the children a better chance of success. (MLH)",

The program was designed to teach teachers how to deliver subject matter associated with &quot;The Teaching of Thinking Skills Program,&quot; sponsored by a Chapter II Competitive Block Grant. The program had two components and two teacher trainer consultants: one for &quot;Writing to Learn&quot; and the other for &quot;Reading to Learn.&quot; The purpose of the case study was to assess teacher attitudes toward the program and program effectiveness. The data collection instruments consisted of an attitude questionnaire; observations of training sessions; and interviews with teachers, consultants, and administrators. The evaluation concluded that teachers felt the program to  be worthwhile, but that the quality of the training sessions required instructional delivery improvement. These improvements included decreasing day-long inservice presentations, diversifying instructional materials, providing subject matter thematic unity, reducing class size, and having more enthusiastic teacher trainers.

Demographic variables of gender, race, and subject area were considered. A random sample of 192 Mississippi teachers of English, math, science, and social studies was drawn from secondary schools having any or all of grades 9 through 12. Respondents (N=120) completed two questionnaires: the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Supervisory Behavior Description Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and t-tests for the dichotomous demographic variables of gender and race. Results showed that teachers' perceptions of their burnout levels and their perceptions of the principals' supervisory behaviors are  related. Teachers who perceived their own levels of emotional exhaustion to be low also perceived their principals as nondirective. Teachers who did feel burned out perceived their principals as directive. These findings suggest that teachers prefer to work on staff development or curricular improvement projects without principal supervision. (JAM)",

Future trends include (1) a growing awareness of the importance of instructional leadership; (2) greater focus on the roots, rather than the symptoms, of behavioral disorders; (3) continuing concerns about financial support; (4) pressure to include more women and minorities in educational administration; and (5) participative school management. In the following discussion of professional development, the term \"Planned Learning Experience\" is first defined as any activity that provides a practicing administrator with knowledge or  skills, or that changes attitudes, and is deliberately planned and presented as a learning event. The general range of learning experiences is described. Basic purposes and assumptions that have been the foundation of most current approaches to planned learning for school administrators are then discussed, along with evidence for the effectiveness of various models and approaches.

        "description":"The recent rise in premarital sexual experience and in pregnancy and births among unmarried teenage women from all socioeconomic groups has focused public, professional, and governmental attention on the immediate and long-term implications of teenage pregnancy. The assumption underlying the need for adolescent parent programs in general is that if a young mother is to improve her prospects, she must continue her education, vocational training, or work experience, and delay subsequent births. This document, therefore, reviews the literature on the socioeconomic, medical, and psychological consequences of teenage pregnancy and on the role of day care in serving the needs of school-age parents and their children. First, national surveys, interview studies, and research and reports  on service programs are reviewed that support the need for day care and other services to young parents. Next, several new approaches to serving the needs of adolescent parents are reviewed, including the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), Project Redirection, school-based programs, and interdistrict programs such as the Family Learning Center in Michigan. Taken together, these national, and local programs and program studies substantiate both the need for and the efficacy of child care as a support service that can improve the life outcomes of both the adolescent mother and her child. Successful programs agree that the necessary components for comprehensive service delivery include education, employment, health and fertility control, and parenting and child development.

Accordingly, in 1987 the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women conducted a survey of 220 child care programs for teen parents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, 14 programs in 3 states were selected for indepth, onsite examination. Objectives of the combined study were (1) to identify a range of model child care services specifically intended for teenage parents; (2) to select programs that represent each of these models for an indepth examination of their  components and the context in which they operate; and (3) to disseminate the results of the study to educators and policymakers in a useful form. Results are reported first for the survey and then for the case studies, and policy recommendations are provided that focus on the following themes: funding, age of the teen population, transition support, family day care, local school policies, staffing, and licensing.

Citing numerous examples of how policymakers consider resource allocations apart from the main concerns of individual programs, the people reallocations affect, and education's most important programs, it suggests that policymakers and finance officers reemphasize program and people priorities rather than financial ones. Noting that curriculum and instruction issues rank a distant fifth behind frontrunner funding issues in the 1988 American Association of School Administrator's Survey, disapproval about funding priorities and program-based budgeting systems is expressed. Political concerns often dictate program funding without regard to the most effective programs. In addition, when expenditures outstrip  income based on foundation levels established according to the annual inflation rate, funding emergencies occur. The report concludes that such a reconceptualization will not prevent policymakers from meeting their long-term or short-term budgeting obligations. Rather, budget flexibility is enhanced because of budgets designed to respond to immediate ongoing program needs, and not to any fixed \"written in stone\" timetable that ends with the fiscal year.

The paper presented here discusses recent research findings and current practice on the adoption, implementation, and integration of microcomputers into the instructional program at the elementary and secondary levels. The first part draws upon a recent two-year study that examined the empirical information derived since 1980 on the adoption, implementation, and integration of microcomputers within the elementary and secondary instructional program in the United States. The research findings are organized around six contextual divisions identified in the study: setting, resources, governance, implementation, process evaluation, and integration. The  subsequent section discusses general implications for action, focusing on two primary areas of responsibility: (1) incorporating computer literacy as an integral part of the curriculum at all instructional levels and (2) exploiting the potential of this technology for improving instructional methodology. The correlates of educational policymaking relative to microcomputer adoption focus on three types of reinvention: operational, technical, and managerial. The final section is a case study of Sacramento City Unified School District's strategic plan entitled \"Opportunity 21: A Guide to the Twenty-First Century.\" This strategy incorporates planning and feedback processes that are critical to the full integration of educational technology into the schools.

        "description":"In three sections, this paper discusses and describes Peer Assisted Leadership (PAL) training from the perspective of two experienced trainers within the context of principals' work lives. PAL training is an intensive 6-day experience in which participants acquire skills in onsite observation, reflective interviewing, theme identification, and model building. The first section compares and contrasts PAL with principals' work realities. Out of this analysis emerges the second section, a list of specific presentation guidelines that mean to assist current and future PAL trainers to minimize training problems and maximize problem-solving. The final section suggests applications of PAL's components and skills in other professonal development programs. It also includes a generic  administrative training support model that integrates PAL with other activities designed to help principals bridge workshop experiences and the work realities of the principalship.

        "description":"This study evaluates the process of desegregation in Buffalo City Public Schools and adds to educational change literature in two ways. First, it analyzes the initiation and implementation phases of school desegregation by describing how the innovation was shaped by participants to fit the system using it. Second, the technique of event analysis shows how the innovation of desegregation polarized Buffalo. Educational change in Buffalo's case not only created conflicts but also the solutions to resolve them. The study concludes that Buffalo has made significant progress in the past 12 years from being a deeply divided city along racial and ethnic lines to becoming genuinely integrated, and it suggests that the desegregation process has been a direct result of school leaders  redirecting issues away from cultural perspectives about race to political levels where good education becomes the focus.

The variables of parents' education, religion, marital status, and reasons for school choice were associated with their degree of involvement. This research provides insights into how family choice and parental involvement mechanisms operate for \"at-risk\" youth in innercity Catholic high schools. While parent characteristics, especially level of education, influence parent communication with teachers, the willingness of school administrators to permit and encourage parental input in decision-making  processes appears to strengthen parent involvement.

        "description":"This publication contains six selected papers from the 30th Anniversary Meeting of the University Council for Educational Administrators (UCEA) in the fall of 1987. The first article, by John A. Thompson discusses problems associated with implementing the agenda of the Holmes Group report in decentralizing the control of schools. Leslie, Snyder, and Giddis, in the second paper, discuss the changes in Florida's administrator preparation programs that delegate virtually all responsibility for training school principals to school districts. In the third study, Pohland, Milstein, Schilling, and Tonigan also take a state level perspective in discussing how the reform climate of the eighties has affected the preparation program at the University of New Mexico. They focus on the flaws  inherent in the technical and corporate models of the educational administrator that are implied in the reform movement. Shapiro, in the fourth study, assesses and contrasts two curricular models: the medical model (oriented toward the clinical experience) and an alternative conceptual model that he labels the \"artificial science\" approach. The last two papers propose shifts in the curricular orientations of preparation programs. Colleen S. Bell argues that managerial instruction attempting to simplify and homogenize organizational experience ill-prepares students for the real life of administration, while Tetenbaum and Mulkeen review gender-based studies that focus on the difference in world view of men and women and differences in the way men and women approach administrative tasks.

A line-by-line content analysis of 138 articles on educational reform published in nine influential professional journals between 1983 and January 1987, showed that the educational reform movement largely ignores issues of gender equity, and that males far outnumber females in authorship and in depiction in photos and illustrations. The report concludes by making the following recommendations to enhance equity in education, which the Excellence in Education movement ignores: (1) Classroom interaction between teachers and students must include more minority and female  participation. (2) Curriculum content must address the academic problem areas that have historically plagued female students, chiefly in mathematics and science, in the same ways that remedial reading programs have traditionally been programmed for males. (3) Understanding why females and minority groups score lower than white males on standardized tests despite higher report card grades requires research. (4) Career counseling reform is needed to avoid course and career segregation and stereotyping. (5) The recruitment and retention of females in educational leadership positions will ensure supervision sensitive to the negative outcomes of gender bias in our nation's schools. (JAM)",

Strategies for involving parents in the process of parent-mediated instruction should also be individualized, and the needs of all family members taken into consideration. Four models of family functioning are described (family systems theory, ABCX, family life cycle, and transactional); common variables such as resources and parental expectancies are identified; and the impact  of selected variables on the level and quality of family involvement is described. The Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) as an extension of the concept of the individualized education program is also discussed. Assessment of the child, the family, and the dynamics of parent-child interaction are described as providing important information for the IFSP planning conference.

Characteristics and strengths of three models of team organization are described: multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary. Results of structured telephone interviews with administrators of 10 infant intervention programs are then presented, touching on the following areas: program staffing patterns (staff availability, core staff roles, and team structure); examples of team processes (assessment, program  planning, and intervention functions); program components supporting team models (role release, communication, role of the developmental specialist, and parent roles). Among implications drawn from these interviews are that the same team model does not necessarily have to apply across all program functions and that team members need to be prepared to function as generalists as well as specialists in their own disciplines.

Next, common core competencies necessary for any professional working in the area of infant service delivery are described and grouped in four categories: infant-related, family-related, teaming, and interagency advocacy. Within  each category, competencies specifically applicable to the infant special educator are delineated (e.g., knowledge of infant cognitive, social, and affective development). Desirable personal attributes (flexibility, maturity, independence, willingness to share, and tolerance) are seen as crossing all disciplines.

The transdisciplinary model is explored in detail and recommended as a system which sets high standards for team collaboration and remedies many of the problems associated with the other two models. Developed in the mid-1970's in response to budget constraints, the transdisciplinary (TD) model is described as a team approach that crosses and recrosses disciplinary boundaries. Separate but related processes which comprise the stages  of TD (summarized as &quot;role release&quot;) are discussed: role extension, role enrichment, role expansion, role exchange, role release, and role support. TD program components are described in detail: intake, assessment (using an &quot;arena&quot; approach), program planning (beginning with the development of an individualized family service plan), program implementation (emphasizing careful selection of the primary service provider), and reassessment. Implications for staff selection are discussed, and benefits of the model for child and family are summarized. References are appended. (JW)",

Three program evaluation models are summarized: Tyler's objective model, Scriven's goal-free model, and Stufflebeam's decision-making model. The latter is seen as the basis of the triphase evaluation process. Steps in the input evaluation phase are described in detail: (1) determine key elements; (2) identify sources of information; (3) develop a management plan; (4) collect data; (5) analyze and interpret data; and (6) develop an intervention program. The purpose of the second phase, process evaluation, is to monitor  progress toward goals and objectives and to modify plans as needed. Research design considerations are explored in a discussion of the outcome phase, emphasizing the importance of a well-conceived, systematically implemented evaluation in order to determine the impact of the program on children, their families, and the community. Finally, standards for a high quality evaluation plan developed by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation are described, focusing on the four elements of utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy.

Questionnaire data indicated that a student in the program was more likely to be male than female, lived with either one or two parents, and was 9 years old or younger and in the third grade or below at program entry. Students were most likely to be referred from a public school special education class and returned to the same type of placement when exiting the program. A second, in-depth questionnaire focused on characteristics of 344  randomly selected students. Data on the educational background and professional experience of classroom, clinical, and administrative personnel were also collected and reported. A cost study examined Network funding sources, determined the cost per student served, and calculated alternative treatment costs, concluding that Network services were provided at less than one-sixth the cost of alternative service delivery models.

In Phase 1, there was a general lack of agreement by 354 educational personnel on the placement of 192 items (47%) within four predetermined categories of behavior (aggressive/acting out, irresponsible/inattentive, socially withdrawn, fearful/anxious). In phase 2, a panel of seven experts participated in an item review process of these 192 items. The addition of two new categories (physiological  deficits and information/thought processing deficits) substantially improved the agreement rate. Among conclusions drawn is that the behavioral categories identified for this study are sufficiently broad to accommodate a wide range of behaviors, yet specific enough to be useful to practitioners. Results lend support to the call for greater uniformity among behavior rating instruments.

Considered are the effects of definitions of deaf-blindness on service provision and on the training of preservice students in this area. Appropriate programs entail intervention methods that address the usage of residual vision and audition as well as the development of other senses. The development of language and communication skills is critical. The range of interpretations of the federal government's definition of deaf blindness has caused a pervasive problem in programming, preservice training, and funding. A variety of alternative definitions are discussed. Early intervention is also defined and the importance of early identification stressed. Two major intervention models, the developmental model and  the functional model, are explained. Early intervention for this population is discussed in terms of visual assessment, visual training, auditory assessment, auditory training, receptive and expressive communication assessment, and functional communication training. Recommendations include adequate assistive programming in sense utilization, development of appropriate preservice training, research on best teaching methods for this population, and involvement of parents and other family members as early in the intervention process as possible.

A formative evaluation of the project showed that administrative problems existed in conducting this type of intervention in a collegiate environment, but also showed some additional benefits of the cognitive instruction: students began to demand more elaboration, to become more careful in checking for error in their work, and to ask for verification from each other on points made during classroom discussion. Recommendations for expansion of the cognitive skills instruction program and recommendations for researchers are offered. (Author/JDD)",

The IOP enables students to develop entry-level vocational abilities, become responsible members of society, and recognize the need for lifelong learning. The IOP is a 5-year program involving academic courses directed to improving students' skills in communication, computation, and social relationships, and opportunities for students to apply these skills in occupational courses. The IOP courses have a community partnership component in which parents, private  citizens, and business and community volunteers come into the school or enable students to go out into the community to apply their learned skills. Procedures for implementing the program focus on the student selection process, funding, selection of IOP teachers and coordinators, inservice training, and development of community partnerships. Instructional strategies for IOP teachers and techniques for maximizing classroom effectiveness are also offered. The manual is designed to be used in conjunction with information provided in curriculum guides and \"Teacher Resource Manuals\" for each subject area. (JDD)",

        "description":"Quantitative assessment instruments have been developed to identify those skills or behaviors which individuals with developmental disabilities need in order to become competitively employed, and to measure individuals' progress in the program and hence measure program effectiveness. Such assessment instruments are problematic, as each employment situation uniquely requires its own particular combination of skills. An attempt to apply quantitative assessment tools in a supported employment situation found that: (1) no job situation existed which required clients to demonstrate many of the skills or behaviors listed on the assessments; (2) some skills/behaviors listed on the assessments were irrelevant to the job situation; and (3) other relevant skills/behaviors were not listed.  The second purpose of assessments, the measurement of program effectiveness, is only appropriate for groups of subjects and does not appropriately measure program effectiveness for individuals. Nor is the use of single subject designs appropriate, as they call for treatments that are introduced either systematically or randomly. A qualitative process model is suggested, where the actual process of implementing the model reveals the relevant variables of the job situation. Items in a qualitative assessment are not quantified but serve as reminders of important factors to be considered. (JDD)",

The principles are: The child and the family have basic rights of self-determination and autonomy. Health care services should be family oriented and maximize family control. Service systems should be community based. Services should be comprehensive and coordinated. Service systems should be accessible and responsive to children with special health care needs and their families. Parents should be early and continuous participants in the long-range planning for their children. Parents should be equal partners with professionals in the care of their children. Normal patterns of living in the home and community should be  encouraged. Support services needed to care for children at home should be adequately funded. Families should help shape policies and procedures that affect health care delivery. Components of community-based programs include: increasing professional, family, and community capability; development of a service plan for the child and family through contract negotiation between families and providers; coordination of a plan for care at home; comprehensive service systems with a full continuum of services; quality assurance of services; a child home health care agenda at federal, state, and local levels.

Support in job procurement and maintenance was provided each student and employers were assisted in making job modifications to suit handicapped workers. The program served 22 to 26 students with two teachers (who also served as caseworkers) and two classroom aides. Administrative support was provided in the areas of  communication, coordination between vocational and special education, and staff evaluation. Changes over the program's 3 years included provision of services during the daytime rather than evening, and moving from a group-centered approach to a more individualized and flexible approach.

The estimates are derived from information gathered through a 1985-86 school year survey in a sample of 60 school districts located in 18 states. Based on the Resource Cost Model, the survey gathered information about the resources, pricing, and pupil enrollments of all special and regular education programs and services provided to students in the sampled districts. Resources were broken down into personnel, supplies, materials, equipment, energy, and space associated with each program. Five categories of special education programs  were studied: preschool, resource, self-contained, residential, and home/hospital. Supplemental service expenditures were also analyzed, including related services, adaptive physical education, and special vocational instruction. In addition, the study documents expenditures for district-level and school-level support services, including supervisory and administrative personnel, curriculum coordinators, community liaison staff, attendance officers, research and evaluation, etc. Five categories of service providers were examined: school districts, cooperatives, other state and local agencies, private schools, and purchased services. The 1985-86 data are compared with per-pupil expenditures obtained from an earlier study conducted in 1977-78. (JDD)",

        "description":"The &quot;language struggle&quot; has been a focus of disagreement throughout South Africa's educational history. In contemporary South Africa, the issue of the language used as a medium of instruction has been most controversial in black education, where the government's policy of initial native language instruction has been widely denounced as an attempt to retribalize black South Africans. The native language policy controversy grows from the historical language struggle in the white community, which deeply influenced government policy toward black education. Before 1800, education was largely controlled by the Dutch, and even the French Huguenots were assimilated into the Dutch community. British occupation around 1800 marked the beginning of serious anglicization of the Cape and legal  establishment of English as the official language. Antagonism grew between Boers and English, and English-medium instruction was inconsistent. In 1892, a law left the choice of medium of instruction up to the parents. The Afrikaans language movement pressed for native-language instruction among Afrikaans children. The 1910 Act of Union made both English and Dutch official languages, affirming bilingualism in education. While the language issue for white education is now largely settled, language remains a highly divisive issue in black education, with blacks largely rejecting native-language-medium schooling.

It is activities-based in that learners use the target language in specific activities for specific purposes. Each activity integrates content with process or method, and activities are planned to relate directly to program goals and objectives. A table of language use has been developed to help teachers categorize language use through activity types for syllabus planning. Five broad goals of language learning are targeted: communication, sociocultural understanding, helping students learn how to learn, language and cultural awareness, and general knowledge. Each of these broad goals is translated into a series of  specific goals. Syllabuses and curriculum materials based on the ALL model are being developed in Australia in a range of languages. Each syllabus is comprised of modules containing specific goals, general objectives, and suggested activities. The modules are organized either around a theme or topic, or around a skill, genre, text, or specific project. Each syllabus also contains a checklist of content to guide teachers in planning units. A series of questions is provided to stimulate teacher awareness of what communicative teaching is. (MSE)",

The journals were used as medium of communication between novice teachers of English as a second language and their supervisors in a field practicum course. Journals were studied to quantify the types of student comments made, and to track the changes in the nature of this commentary over time. Journal entries were coded for type and analyzed during the course of the field experience. The present discussion includes the rationale for implementing the technique in a methodology course or field practicum, a sample student-teacher dialogue, representative student entries for each of the categories examined, and a description of the coding process.

However, word processing and simple desktop publishing technology can help realize several often elusive goals of ESL: creation of an authentic information vehicle providing contact with a genuine audience (other students); involvement of writers at different ability levels; flexible integration of different kinds of work, prepared at variable rates and in any order; and production of a written document truly reflecting the interests and identities of its student authors. Such a project requires careful assessment of and adherence to specific communicative criteria. In addition, newspapers can work only with considerable cooperation among students and the teacher. These  more personal elements are as important as the technology. The potential difficulties must be addressed realistically for the effort to be successful. (Author/MSE)",

It seeks to establish the prototype concept of each preposition and the degrees of prototypicality by testing for native-speaker choices of examples that illustrate best the most basic use of the preposition. The prepositions studied are \"in, on, at, and over\" (English) and \"en and sobre\" (Spanish). The study also tests the hypothesis that the English preposition whose prototype corresponds most closely to the prototype of a given Spanish preposition tends to be preferred to other prepositions by Spanish speakers learning English, regardless of whether or not it is appropriate, in contexts in which that Spanish preposition would be used. Four instruments were  designed to determine prototype concepts and degree of prototypicality. It is concluded that some prepositions are describable in terms of prototypes and others are better stated in terms of an abstract set of defining features. In addition, there appear to be \"latent\" prototypes that may not be elicited easily except under certain conditions, such as the need to express oneself in another language. (Author/MSE)",

During its third year, the program served 314 students of widely varying preparedness in the content areas and in native and English language proficiency. Project funds supported a central project director and a resource teacher and paraprofessional at each site. Staff development activities  included conference and workshop attendance, on-site training sessions, and some university course attendance. Parent involvement consisted of parent advisory councils, trips and cultural festivals, and conferences on school-related topics. Quantitative analysis of student achievement data indicates that program objectives were not met in English language skills and content area achievement, and could not be measured in native language development. However, the program's attendance rate was significantly higher than the school-wide attendance rate. Recommendations for program improvement include reestablishment of parent English and Americanization classes, class organization, staff development, and modification of objectives. (MSE)",

        "author":["Dey, Eric L."],
        "description":"In this study, student liberalism is examined longitudinally to determine whether it changes as the result of being exposed to different educational environments. The effect of college on liberalism and the relative efficacy of different measures of the college environment are also addressed. The main focus is on the effect of student peers. Data were drawn from the 1983 Cooperative Institutional Research Program survey sponsored by the American Council on Education and the University of California at Los Angeles Higher Education Research Institute. Results indicate that the effect that college has upon liberalism appears to be due to socialization effects. Effects commonly attributed to the educational process may in fact be due to social forces that exist outside of college,  suggesting that many of the findings related to affective student outcomes may need to be reexamined. While it is possible that changes in liberalism are due to cognitive or psychodynamic changes in students, these results indicate that involvement in different social systems affects liberalism differently. Colleges may not directly affect student values, yet bring students of different values together. Instead of developing and promoting values among students, colleges may simply serve as forums that reinforce generally held social values. Researchers may need to try to integrate more proximal measures of student experiences. By relying on structural characteristics to measure the college environment, they are adopting an imprecise frame of reference for interpretation. It is concluded  that while college promotes liberalism, the effect is neither large nor universal, and college may now have a moderating rather than liberalizing effect. Contains 28 references.

        "description":"The status of litigation involving dismissals of tenured faculty for reasons of incompetence, broadly defined, is evaluated. In practice, there is no consensus within higher education as to what constitutes adequate cause based on incompetence for dismissal of faculty members. The following issues are explored: (1) the pattern of increasing litigation; (2) patterns of litigation by institutional type; (3) forums for disputing these litigations; (4) prevailing parties to the dispute; (5) procedural issues that have been litigated; (6) substantative issues that have been litigated; (7) subcategories of behavior alleged to be incompetent; and (8) the role of the court in resolving disputes over faculty dismissals. All recorded court decisions which resulted in the dismissal of a  tenured faculty member in a postsecondary institution for reasons of incompetence from January 1960 through March 1988 were surveyed. The resulting patterns of litigation are discussed, providing perspectives about the court's role in disputes over evaluation of tenured faculty. The growing judicial involvement--state and federal--in such decisions, and variation in litigation by type of institution are discussed. The fairly strong position of institutions involved in litigation is confirmed. The caselaw illustrates the importance of procedural issues in litigating. Classification of the cases on dismissal for incompetence into three subcategories (incompetence, insubordination, and neglect of duty) sheds some light on litigation patterns and strategies.

        "description":"First year university students are identified and categorized according to their motivations for enrolling in colleges. Characteristics and achievements of students with varying motivations are discussed, and changes in motivation during the first year of college are explored. Students were surveyed in the fall during the first 2 weeks of class to obtain demographic information and measures of motivation and commitment. They were resurveyed in the spring during the last month of classes of the same academic year to obtain new measures and motivation. The following classifications of motivational orientations were identified for undergraduates: certification, cognitive, community service, change, social, recommendation, and escape. Some of the changes in motivation may be viewed  as positive, and others as negative. An increase in measure of the cognitive or community service scales may be viewed as positive movement toward certain stated goals of higher education, but increases on the escape, recommendation, or change scales could be viewed as negative. The subgroups of community service, social, cognitive, escape, and certification showed significant decreases in the motivation factor in which they had initially scored highest. Students in this study showed a significant increase in the recommendation motivation factor (recommendations of others increased in importance as a reason to enroll in college). Further research might focus on types of experiences which may be related to increasing one's desire to serve others or to increasing one's intellectual thirst.  Contains 18 references. (Author/SM)",

Some of the related research questions are: whether academic departments within coeducational universities intended mostly to serve women (such as education, library science, women's physical education, hygiene, nursing, and home economics) automatically start out low in status, power, and prestige; whether their status rises or falls over time; and how they sustain their existence. Focus was on the following: Agnes Fay Morgan, the female institution builder (a PhD in chemistry who became chair of the household  science division of the department, reorganized it into an independent department, and tried to raise the status of her department); hiring of faculty; building a curriculum; research activities; space and research facilities; changing the name of the department; the graduate group in nutrition; visibility; and gender and status. It is noted that gender and status form a vicious circle, and that gender played a crucial role during the life of the Department of Home Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. The case demonstrates how significant gender is as a factor in ranking academic departments. (SM)",

        "description":"A study conducted to examine the careers of higher education doctoral recipients ascertains their demographics and career patterns and discerns the existence of possible differences in career paths depending upon types of higher education programs (such as national, regional, research oriented, and locally oriented collections of courses). This follows a concern that if the market for graduates of higher education doctoral programs becomes saturated, prospective students may see little value in the degree for career advancement, and enrollments in higher education programs may dwindle. The population for the study was all graduates of doctoral programs in higher education in 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1987. Program directors for each of the chosen 130 programs were surveyed to gather  demographic and descriptive information about their higher education programs. Results are discussed in terms of demographics, employment history, the perceived value of a higher education doctorate, and programmatic differences in career paths. Findings indicate the importance of carefully recruiting potential students who are not already in higher education positions since possession of the higher education degree alone does not seem to facilitate getting a position in academe. The importance of being honest about the degree's potential value for upward career moves in certain institutional types must be stressed, and individual higher education programs need to conduct ongoing self-evaluations. A substantial number of higher education doctoral recipients believe they made a poor choice  in choosing higher education as a field of study. Contains 25 references and 14 tables. (SM)",

        "description":"The different conceptual approaches to organizational culture used in the last decade are discussed to provide clarity for cultural researchers in higher education. Emphasis is on the differences between functional and interpretive perspectives of organizational culture. The underlying assumptions, rationales, and methodological implications are highlighted for each perspective. Recent studies of organizational culture are reviewed to provide an understanding of different conceptual approaches to culture. Organizational metaphors and the cultural view of organizations are discussed, and cultural analysis and organizational administration are explained. It is suggested that organizational behavior in general, and the functional school of organizational culture specifically, are  driven largely by the desire for rules and management guidelines. The functionalist intends to highlight principles and concerns of culture so that managers may become more skilled in manipulating cultural variables. Cultural anthropologists and the interpretive schools do not want to be applied problem solvers. The interpretive perspective is more theoretical and less applied. The interpretive approach believes that managers influence organizational meaning and that an awareness of the enactment that occurs in an organization aids in effective management.

The influence of these factors on students' educational plans are discussed. The sample for this study was drawn from all students attending 21 Indiana high schools. Families of ninth grade students were mailed a packet with two survey instruments (for parents and students). A second mailing, a month later, contained additional surveys for parents and students. The results indicate that parents' influences on students' aspirations  were both complex and varied. The level of father's education exerted the strongest indirect and direct effects on students' postsecondary education plans, but the effects of the level of fathers' and mothers' education varied for male and female ninth grade students. Neither discussion with parents about postsecondary education nor parental level of saving had major direct effects on the aspirations of male students, but for female students, the frequency with which they discussed college with their parents had a negative effect on their educational plans. Coming from single parent families had a relatively small effect. Findings suggest there could be subtle differences within each family affecting male and female students. Contains 36 references.

Data were manipulated in order to, among other things: rank practices according to the extent of proponence and usage; rank widely applicable support service practices,  and characterize the institution as a whole. The data indicate the university is potentially responsive to adult undergraduates, but there is not a widely shared attitude that adult undergraduates are legitimate and growing. Recommendations include that: the university direct additional and public support to an academic advisors council, an office of adult learning services be established, and a task force assess the need for after 4:00 P.M. course offerings, determine older student enrollment rates in independent studies, and improve the articulation of continuing education modes of instruction.

The collaborative model's purpose is to attract talented minority high school students to teaching and related educational careers, and to present evaluative data that measure the impact of student participation and long-range outcomes. MENTOR in Education, designed to interest high school students in pursuing careers in teaching, provides a laboratory for joint planning among public and private graduate institutions and the New York City Board of Education. The program also explores alternative approaches to teacher preparation in an urban  setting. It is funded by the New York Alliance for the Public Schools, a coalition of civic, corporate, and educational leaders in New York City. Its main components, involving 125 high school juniors and seniors each semester, are peer teaching and work with younger children, college seminars and workshops, site visits to specialized schools, and activities such as journals, micro-teaching, and lesson planning. The mentoring process has been reinforced on several levels: students find their greatest satisfaction in the act of teaching; recruitment into the program has been strengthened by its institutionalization in the respective high school/college pairings and the addition of extrinsic rewards for participation; and extended participation reinforces the mentor experience. Student  participant surveys, teacher evaluations, site visits, and follow-up interviews revealed the following: predominance of female participants; participant racial breakdown--49.2% black, 31.2% white, 7.8% Asian, and 9.8% white; greater knowledge about teacher training; and greater awareness of careers in education other than teaching. To alleviate the shortage of minority teachers, new strategies are needed to identify potential candidates at an early phase in career development and provide support systems to sustain them. Two appendices include the MENTOR in Education final student survey and follow-up survey. Tables are included. Contains 9 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Two decades following the publication of David G. Brown's &quot;Criteria for Pruning Programs,&quot; (which recognized that traditional financial support to higher education was decreasing and proposed 10 guidelines for evaluating existing programs) a study was developed to determine what criteria are actually being used by comprehensive universities and state coordinating boards to determine which programs to reduce or eliminate. The study looks at the manner in which academic administrators perceive the relative value of each criterion in an ideal evaluation system, recognizing that this might differ a bit from what is happening in practice. A questionnaire was developed that operationalized Brown's guidelines for evaluating programs for possible reduction. The original criteria were  modified to include centrality, critical mass, complementariness, program vitality, substitutability or duplication, cost benefit analysis, quality, demand, and uniqueness. Surveys were distributed to the vice chancellors for academic affairs of the 50 state higher education boards that are members of the State Higher Education Executive Officers, and 76 were distributed to public universities represented in the 50 states. It is concluded that the criteria suggested by Brown are still relevant today. The findings verify that Brown's nine modified criteria are the key factors used at both research university and state coordinating board levels for decisions resulting in program reduction or elimination. Tables are included along with a copy of the questionnaire and a listing of the  institutions. (SM)",

        "description":"The relative influence of selected life history experiences on the development of three vocational types (investigative, social, and enterprising) proposed by J. L. Holland is studied using causal modeling procedures. The lack of explicitness in the developmental postulates of Holland's theory is seen as a major deficiency. Among the principal postulates of the theory is that most persons can be characterized by their resemblance to each of six personality types (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional). A recent study using a biographical questionnaire demonstrates wide variations in the life histories of men and women in the six vocational types. Subjects for this study were obtained from respondents to the 1971 Cooperative Institutional  Research Programs survey (completed on entering college in 1971) which obtained a broad array of personal information. Subjects also completed a follow-up survey in 1980 that gathered data on college experiences and educational and occupational achievements in the 9-year period. Findings support Holand's general premise that vocational type development is a function of a complex series of events resulting from family backgrounds, initial personal orientations and occupational preferences, and interactions with alternative environmental settings. The relative importance of life history experiences varies among the three types. Where one goes to college and what one does have important consequences for the development of Holland vocational types. Tables are included. Contains 29 references.  (Author/SM)",

        "description":"A study on leadership, conflict management, research and development (R&amp;D) worker motivation, commitment, and risk-taking propensity in universities compared with corporations and government is presented. It arose from the recognition that R&amp;D in any developed country is critical to the continued well-being of its economy and people, and that university R&amp;D management must continually be assessed. The three countries used in this study are Japan, the United States, and England, with focus on Japan. The following topics were examined: psychological characteristics of effective academic and industrial research leaders; styles of conflict management predominating in effective and ineffective leaders; impact of leader characteristics defined by the three independent variables on  subordinate motivation and creativity; laboratory orientation; the market force effect on variables of interest; and leadership at the end of the project. Unlike the United States and England, education and industry are not closely articulated in Japan, and advanced education and training is largely relegated to on-the-job programs. In the United States individuality is tolerated and encouraged but in education, R&amp;D is disadvantaged by its separation from industry. Four appendices include: demographic differences between corporations, universities, and government laboratories; leader attitudes and values; differences between sections rated high or low quality, and theoretical and policy implications.

        "description":"How different institutions conceive of and construct knowledge is examined by delineating how they enact their conception of knowledge through curriculum. The contention of Burton Clark and others that disciplinary activity is primarily responsible for fomenting knowledge production is argued. It is suggested that institutions have a more powerful influence on how people define knowledge than previously thought. Knowledge is called a discourse constantly reconstructed over time and place. Three case studies (&quot;Christian University,&quot;&quot;Classics College,&quot; and &quot;Cutting Edge College&quot;) show that institutions play a role in interpreting knowledge. Implications for institutional leaders are manifold since the ideological apparatus of the mission seems to play a more determined role than  previously thought. The role of the faculty demands further analysis and reformulation. Pedagogical practices, teacher-student interaction, faculty-faculty interaction, and other cultural variables come into play by way of the participants' definition of knowledge. A way to think about reconceptualizing knowledge and the institution is to consider how faculty can create goals that reaffirm the unique nature of the educational process and their institutions. The discourse among faculty is related to how the institution creates, structures, and disseminates knowledge. One question that demands further analysis is what strategies organizational participants might use to offer students an understanding of their own relationship to the nature of knowledge.

Environmental factors include demographic, economic, political, and sociopolitical factors. Data were drawn from annual reports of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, &quot;State Tax Funds for Operating Expenses of Higher Education&quot;; from the U.S. Bureau of the Census reports; and from National Center for  Education statistics reports. Results indicate the environment as a whole plays some part in the state appropriations process over time, at least as far as public universities are concerned, but that not all environmental factors are of equal importance either between or within states. There is no consistency in terms of the effects of the environmental factors between the states. The results imply a need to study the more abstract and less quantifiable aspects of state political systems as they relate to policy/appropriation outcomes for public higher education.

Data were drawn from a national sample of black students currently enrolled in selected black and white, state-supported universities. This study uses the interactionist perspective and draws from the social structure and personality perspective. Evidence suggests that black students on black campuses are more disadvantaged in socioeconomic and academic terms than are black (or white) students on white campuses, but students on black  campuses display more positive psychosocial adjustments, great academic gains, and greater cultural awareness/commitment. Central in the determination of how individual and institutional characteristics influence black student experiences in higher education are students' interpersonal relationships which form the bridge between individual dispositions and institutional tendencies.

The focus is on the key decision making groups in the university (the president's office, the deans, the senate, the board, and the faculty association). Certain university contexts are  identified, and the link between them and the retrenchment strategy is discussed (the decentralized collegium, the technocratic bureaucracy, the sectarian university, the collegial bureaucracy, and the centralized collegium).

        "description":"The work content of eight midwestern college and university presidents is defined and described through direct observation of daily activities. This was done as a critical first step in a line of research which can eventually propose effective presidential work behaviors. Besides discovering how time is used, the study finds that due to the volume of input and requests, presidents cannot personally meet most demands and also accomplish organizational success. Concepts identified from the structured and unstructured data led to the development of the Williamson Wall Model of Presidential Work, a framework for future testing of hypotheses about presidential effectiveness. One week of data collection was spent with each of the eight presidents in the final sample. (These eight  represent a consent rate of 33% of the potential respondents whose colleges met the study criteria). One of the key outcomes was the conclusion that there is a great deal of work directed to the president that cannot, should not, and must not be done by the president personally, if at all. Proper presidential work should be defined in part as fulfilling the needs that only the president can meet for the organization, with priorities and goals focusing the work. The four themes (or building blocks for presidential work leading to organizational success) resulting from this study are: (1) antecedents (preexisting resources at the school or within the president's personality), (2) aura (power of the presidency), (3) actions (consciously chosen goals), and (4) advancements.

Initial steps taken to describe the scholar, to develop a model, and to investigate the potential of moving toward a separate integrated entity are presented. The objectives in this regard are: (1) to determine faculty interest in integrating teaching and research; (2) to begin developing a definition of the scholar by identifying component parts; (3) to delineate these component parts; and (4) to test and evaluate interventions designed to move in the direction of the goals and ideals proposed for the scholar. In a survey at a doctoral granting institution, 65% of the faculty indicated a  strong desire to integrate teaching and research. The scholar model, while still in its development, shifts the focus of activities from those that question the relationship between teaching and research to those that assume that relationship and seek to define it. The scholar model has the following integrated characteristics: disseminating knowledge, integrating knowledge, discovering knowledge, communicating knowledge, and applying knowledge. The four types of activities in which research is trying to make the model effective are: graduate training; activities utilizing and implementing the scholar goals; activities that serve to enhance characteristics of the scholar; and moving the institutional reward system toward reflecting the model.

The direct and indirect effects of ability to pay on persistence in the context of such non-economic variables as significant others, academic skills and abilities, academic integration, social integration, and goal commitment are explored. The study sample came from the National Longitudinal High School and Beyond 1980 Senior Cohort. Subjects included 1,375 college students at public four-year institutions. The study shows effects of ability to pay are significant not only when the variable is considered alone,  but also when other variables are incorporated into the analysis. Results support the hypothesis that ability to pay moderates the effect of goal commitment upon persistence in a manner consistent with the expanded model. No support was found for the presumed academic integration goal commitment interaction effect. There is a significant effect on persistence by the interaction between satisfaction with faculty and satisfaction with institutional prestige, but none by skills and abilities. Findings indicate that the ability to pay is best understood as an external factor that directly affects decisions to persist. Tables and figures are included. Contains 74 references. (Author/SM)",

The four study objectives were to: (1) develop a theoretical model to explain retention rates at different Liberal Arts Colleges II in which the institution is the unit of the analysis, (2) estimate the explanatory power of the model, (3) identify institutional variables important in explaining institutional retention rates, and (4) suggest revisions of the model and identify the implications of the study's findings. One way in which the proposed model differs from the Tinto (1975) and Bean (1983) models is that the institution rather than the student is the unit of analysis. Questionnaires were completed by students at 118  schools meeting the criteria for inclusion in the study. There were 49 items on the questionnaire which asked for such information as enrollment, size of endowment, and tuition. Among the findings are the following: the theoretical model was useful in analyzing the process through which institutional variables affect retention rate; the most important determinant of retention is institutional financial viability; and only five of the theoretical model's 20 variables proved to be major predictors of persistence. Recommendations include further examination of the nature of the relationship between financial viability and retention, and testing the theoretical model with other measures of student retention at other types of institutions.

The four objectives were to: (1) obtain baseline data on the existence and status of a variety of institutional policies governing research and research related activities by faculty and graduate students; (2) gather data on the incidence and handling of reported cases of conflict of interest/commitment and of misconduct; (3) learn what deans believe will be the most important issues relevant to policies and procedures for  research and graduate education in their institutions over the next 5 years; and (4) gauge the importance that institutions of higher education attach to training in ethics and values as part of graduate education and the extent to which such training is occurring. A mailed survey was completed by 259 deans of institutions affiliated with the Council of Graduate Schools. Results are discussed as follows: conflict of interest and misconduct; conflict of interest and the role of graduate students; integrity and misconduct in research and scholarship; values training and socialization; university policies and professional ethics; and the university's moral role in research and graduate education. Twenty tables are included. Contains 19 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Interest in the relationship of entrepreneurship to organizational performance and validity is widely and increasingly discussed in educational contexts. An examination of academic entrepreneurship is presented in this paper. Five types of entrepreneurship are described, and many questions more directly related to organizational theory are examined, including the structure of entrepreneurship as a behavioral construct, the relation between individual entrepreneurship and possible predictors, the entrepreneurial elite, and whether there is any institutional patterning that suggests that universities have distinctive entrepreneurial strategies. Two surveys conducted in 1985 used a sample of life scientists and key administrators in major research universities. The life scientists  were mailed a questionnaire dealing with their research activities. Data on university policies and characteristics were collected in a phone survey of 40 administrators having the most responsibility for life science departments. Data suggest that scientifically productive scholars are more entrepreneurial, and most academic groups do not develop norms that encourage multiple forms of entrepreneurship. A tentative conclusion is that entrepreneurship in academic settings is not an either/or condition, nor are the different forms minor variations on a similar social phenomenon.

        "description":"This report is one in a series of country studies prepared in the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Education Committee activity on changing patterns of finance in higher education. In order to contribute to the OECD activity from the Japanese perspective, the Research Institute for Higher Education at Hiroshima University organized a project called &quot;Social and Economic Changes in Industrialized Countries and Their Challenges to Higher Education.&quot; Many experts agree that many of the current problems in Japan's higher education originated during postwar development, when public resources consistently lagged behind the rising social and private demands. Through the unprecedented enrollment expansion of the 1960s, a sharp differentiation  developed between the relatively few and protected public institutions and a large number of private institutions with inadequate educational conditions and substantial user charges. Eradication of the sharp disparity between the public and private sectors constituted the major challenge to higher education policy in the 1970s. The developments since 1970 have left Japanese higher education with significant structural consequences, particularly the improvement in financial conditions of the private institutions. The recent Ad Hoc Council on Education called for increased government expenditure on higher education. Statistical information on higher education finance, student support, issues and recent reforms, and prospects in Japan is provided. Appended are tables on the higher education  system and government expenditures, finances of higher education institutions, and student aid and student living. Contains 19 references. (SM)",

The number of high school graduates increased about 6% in 1986-87, which was accompanied by an increase in the number of new freshmen at the University of California (UC), California State University (CSU), and California independent colleges and universities, but not at the California community colleges. The UC participation rate decreased to 7.7% from 7.9% after having increased steadily over 10 years; CSU rose from 10.2% to 10.7%, the highest in the past 14 years; the community colleges dropped from 36.3% to 34.4%,  possibly as a result of improved reporting; and the rate for California's independent colleges and universities remained at 3.4% for the 47 institutions reporting. The proportions for Asian, Filipino, and Hispanic students were slightly larger in fall 1987 ethnic distribution than in fall 1986, while proportions for American Indian, Black, and White students were all smaller. Black and Hispanic youth continue to be seriously underenrolled in higher education.

Ways to help applicants improve their chances of selection in a competitive process are identified. Every year, there are about 1,000 Fulbright awards for research and teaching in over 100 countries; most applications are not successful (e.g., in the 1983-84 program year there were 3,045 applications and 774 grants). Research awards are more competitive than are lecturing awards. In general, the competition is keenest for awards in popular areas such as Western Europe, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. Some factors which influence the attractiveness of an  award are: need for a foreign language; perceived attractiveness of living in a particular place; resources for productive research; personal safety; respect for human and civil rights; and cultural familiarity. In many less developed countries, there are often unfilled awards. Those applicants who can lecture in a foreign language have an advantage over other applicants.

The question of whether professional education precludes a coherent liberal arts curriculum is raised. At St. Cloud, relationships between the liberal arts and professional programs are primarily in the form of discrete requirements for service courses. In 1986, it received funding to implement a program in professional ethics organized around the theme of responsibility in professional life. The St. Cloud program is described, with emphasis on multidisciplinary ethics across-the- curriculum. The major elements include the development of case studies and an all-university seminar in professional ethics. The impact on  faculty, students, and curriculum has been dramatic. One of the reasons it has been so successful is because it was built from the ground up.

        "description":"The methods with which Northern Illinois University (NIU) has implemented enrollment-management change and developed a more efficient enrollment-management process are noted. Some of the techniques used to better understand the admissions and demand environments and NIU's place in them are discussed to help other institutions with the uncertainties of enrollment-management. NIU's enrollment-management process changes markedly from year to year according to available resources (space, faculty, funding) and student demand. It is much easier to anticipate resource availability than student demand patterns, so NIU's methods of understanding and predicting student demand for new freshman admission are noted. The first step is forecasting the number of high school seniors in the NIU  service area. The next step takes place in summer when the Institutional Research Office aids the president and provost in establishing enrollment targets for new freshmen and transfers. An enrollment simulation is performed using a Markov model, and the results give the number of new freshmen and transfers to be enrolled. Once the target for regularly-admissible students is set, attention shifts to forecasting applications, acceptances, and enrollments by ACT/high school rank combinations. To determine what can be expected from this competitive group, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed. Data on applicants and their status are updated weekly so crises do not arise from slow reaction to changes in the environment. The use of an Ad Hoc Admission/Enrollment Committee is invaluable because  it hears from offices dealing directly with potential students and can anticipate changing demand patterns not reflected in numbers.

        "author":["Zaporozhetz, Laurene Elizabeth"],
        "description":"Thirty-three active doctoral advisors on the faculty of a research oriented university participated in a study of the way faculty advisors prepare their doctoral candidates for the literature review portion of the dissertation. It is noted that common student opinions are: their own library use skills are inadequate; this inadequacy is shameful; and the inadequacy would be revealed by asking questions. The overall response pattern from the 33 advisors indicates the following beliefs and general advising procedures: (1) they consider refereed journals, books, dissertations, and ERIC the most productive bibliographic formats for the dissertation literature review in education; (2) they rank the literature review chapter the lowest of the five standard dissertation chapters when  reflecting on their level of advising expertise and the amount of time they give to a chapter; (3) they rank the research/methodology chapter highest on both counts; (4) some of them have little knowledge of computerized searching technologies; (5) they expect their advisees to have bibliographic skills at the doctoral level; and (6) advisors should offer assistance after doctoral candidates do the literature review and return with the results. Study findings suggest that graduate programs should examine and update the doctoral advising procedures and policies, consider bibliographic instruction on par with research methodology instruction in the preparation of doctoral candidates, and reexamine the current admission policy. Two appendices provide a copy of the preliminary questionnaire  and tables describing members of the study group. Contains 66 references. (Author/SM)",

        "description":"The 23rd annual report of national normative data on the characteristics of students attending American colleges and universities as first-time, full-time freshmen is presented. This project of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program of the American Council on Education and the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles, assesses the effects of college on students. Information is provided on the American freshman (national norms for fall 1988) and the 1988 national norms (type of institutions and control for men, women, and all freshmen). The major stratifying factors are institutional race, control, type, and the selectivity level of the institution. Survey results include: freshman participation in all major federal financial aid programs  continues to decline; the 18-year rise in freshman interest in business majors may have peaked; there is a modest increase in the proportion of students planning to pursue nursing careers; there is rising interest in teaching careers; and 72.6% say concerns about jobs and money are reasons why they attend college. Seven appendices show: research methodology; 1988 student information form; coding scheme for collapsed items; participating institutions; precision of the normative data and their comparisons; sample report furnished to campuses; and some comments on comparing certain survey results from various versions of the norms report. Two summary reports are also attached. Along with 4 tables and 13 figures, the report contains 12 references. (SM)",

An integrated telecommunications channel is at the heart of the design for an ISDN (integrated services digital network). ISDN is a set of technical standards and a network architecture that describe a digital telecommunications channel able to carry voice, data, and compressed video on the same telecommunications network. Two central issues are how an integrated telecommunications system will differentially affect voice, data, and video users, and whether ISDN inherently favors large or small &quot;customers&quot; for telecommunications services. The conceptual discussion is  followed by a case study of a large university (Ohio State) in the process of developing an integrated telecommunications system. (26 references) (Author/EW)",

The erroneous or inefficient student-written lines are neutralized but retained in the REM statements so that they can be compared by the student with the correct lines.

The paper begins by explaining the problem solving strategy used, which is referred to as receiver site transfer, and points out that it shifts the emphasis from attempts to brainstorm possible new solutions for a local problem to comparing and analyzing solutions to similar problems in other locations, and attempting to adapt those solutions to fit the local situation. Results obtained from analyses of the message  interactions which occurred during the project are then presented for each of four analytical techniques, i.e., InterMessage analysis, Message Flow analysis, Message Act analysis, and Semantic Trace analysis. Network versus face-to-face interactions in the classroom are compared, and the advantages of using an electronic network as a medium for students to conduct problem solving activities are discussed. Several other types of projects that would be appropriate for the receiver site transfer technique are discussed, and three other problem-solving strategies that have been used in network-based activities are briefly described.

The major features of ACOT are identified as the ideas of computer saturation and local site development. Of particular concern in this paper is the evaluation of the technology within the context of the usual goal-focused educational assessment. It is suggested that the assessment of the technology assists in the identification of appropriate goals through a process entitled technology push, which allows for outcomes to be empirically identified as desired consequences of the technology's  implementation. A model for the assessment is provided that attempts to incorporate evaluation features central to the schools in which ACOT has been developed, i.e., educational goals, processes, and outcomes. Finally, specific evaluation questions are formulated for the comparison of students at different ACOT sites, and specific achievement measurements are suggested.

Exposure to the programming was assessed using a self-report with parent verification, while familiarity with the toys was assessed through two ranking tasks and three character identification tasks. The results showed that toy-based programming is an effective tool in imparting knowledge about the toy products associated with the programs. Heavy viewers were able to name more of the 10 representative toys that had been selected for the study than  light viewers. The heavy viewers were also more familiar with the attributes of the toys that are based on the scripts of the programs. Some differences were found based on age, with older boys showing greater familiarity than younger boys. (1 table) (EW)",

Optical disk formats are then described by capability: Read Only Memory (ROM), Write Once, Read Many (WORM), Interactive (I), and Erasable (E); forms of information (audio, text or data, video or graphics, or a combination); and disk size (most often 12 or 4.72 inches in diameter). Some 12-inch formats are then briefly described: optical digital data disk, videodisc, digital video disk, and interactive video disk. Brief descriptions of compact disk formats cover compact audio disk, compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), and compact disk-write once, read many (CD-WORM). Future formats currently under development are also briefly described, including HDTV video disk (readable by  high-definition television), compact disk-interactive (CD-I), digital video interactive (DVI), and compact disk-erasable magneto optic (CD-EMO). It is concluded that, although the new technology presents some problems, these problems will disappear within the next few years because of the new formats and systems being developed.

        "description":"This paper discusses the central role of effective communication in library leadership and how a leadership role in the library and information community can define and help establish an information infrastructure in our society. The opportunity for this leadership to exist in the convergence of libraries and computer centers is examined in a review of the report &quot;Freedom and Equality of Access to Information&quot; and documentation of the movement of computer centers and libraries toward each other within colleges. Particular attention is called to the Adler/Rodman communication model, the successful use of which would depend largely on effective communication between the two realms of libraries and computer centers. The discussion of this model demonstrates in detail the difficulty  of communication in this interface situation and suggests that the librarian wishing to influence the computer center personnel must be sure that: (1) the message itself is clearly communicated without unnecessary information; (2) the message is coded in such a way that it will be decoded accurately; and (3) an appropriate channel is chosen. Additional viewpoints are presented on the challenge to library leadership posed by the merging of libraries and computer centers in the context of leadership toward an information infrastructure involving electronic publishing, communication, and leadership for the public good.

The model identifies six concerns faced by all colleges: (1) access and equity; (2) employment preparation and placement; (3) college/university transfer; (4) economic development; (5) college/community  partnerships; and (6) cultural and cross-cultural development. Related to these six areas are 38 indicators of quality, which provide a foundation for the assessment of institutional effectiveness in terms of outcomes measures related to institutional mission.

Reports submitted by the colleges in 1988 indicate that: (1) between 1984 and 1988, the colleges collectively reviewed 7,402 discrete degree and certificate programs and baccalaureate/transfer disciplines, as well as 575 instructional support programs; (2) over 700 of the 7,402 programs underwent continued review over a two-year period; (3) 279 programs were identified for discontinuation or phase out, with the largest number of these being discipline-specific baccalaureate/transfer  associate degree programs; (4) in the occupational areas, business had the largest number of curricula identified for withdrawal; (5) 179 of these programs were withdrawn from the Illinois Community College Board's (ICCB's) listing of approved program offerings; (6) some programs were discontinued but not actually withdrawn because the colleges believed the lack of need for the programs was temporary; (7) during 1988, 1,447 instructional programs and 161 student and academic support services were reviewed, and 103 were identified for withdrawal.

Chapter 1 discusses the problem of low retention among Native Hawaiian students and the need for institutional change to improve recruitment and retention services. After chapter 2 provides a review of the literature on institutional change, chapter 3 outlines the methodology used to conduct a case-study review of the NHVEP. Chapter 4 presents the case study itself, describing the background, objectives, activities, and organizational dynamics of the NHVEP. This chapter includes information on the  demographics and academic participation and performance of Native Hawaiians, the impetus for the project, and a status report on the project. Finally, chapter 5 offers conclusions regarding: (1) methods used by various types of institutions to initiate change; (2) the ways in which significant events, philosophies, and beliefs can bring about meaningful change; (3) the impact of special programs in general and the NHVEP in particular as catalysts for change; (4) general approaches taken by colleges and universities to respond to high attrition and low student retention; (5) research findings regarding the transformational or evolutionary nature of change; and (6) the university's receptiveness to a statement on institutional change.

        "description":"These reports describe and evaluate Illinois Central College's Quality Undergraduate Education for Student Transfers (QUEST) program. The core of the program is to develop in students 15 competencies identified as essential to an educated person: communication skills, mathematics skills, appreciation of physical well-being, understanding of the natural world, understanding of our society, understanding of technology, understanding of our cultural heritage, information-gathering skills, critical thinking skills, effective group interaction, self-examination/self-worth, tolerance and social responsibility, leadership, intellectual curiosity, and an individual value system. All of the competencies are taught across the curriculum, but seven are also the focus of specific courses.  The program emphasizes active modes of teaching and learning, including small group work, study groups, independent study, and open-ended assignments. The program seeks to foster the sense that students belong to a community of learning, through a mentor program, an orientation program, assessments of students' talents and interests, cultural activities, and service to the community. The descriptive report discusses the 15 competencies, teaching methods, and the development of a community of learning. The evaluative report considers program costs and revenue, enrollments, retention rates, academic performance, and responses to a student survey regarding QUEST and its effect on their academic life. Appendixes present the results of high school counselor interviews; results of a faculty  survey; QUEST faculty meeting notes; a survey of sophomore QUEST students; a summary of pre- and post-assessments of learning; and a QUEST manual.

IHS has had great success in improving student attendance, retention, academic achievement, and graduation. Because of its location on the LCC campus, students have access to all college facilities and are surrounded by positive role models. Special features of IHS are: (1) faculty members use English as a Second Language techniques to reinforce English language development in all classes; (2) extended day study opportunities are provided; (3) all graduates are guaranteed admission to LCC; (4) an Integrated Learning Center provides individualized and small group  experiential learning opportunities; and (5) all students participate in a mandatory out-of-school internship program. Students must complete the same requirements for graduation as all other New York State students. All full-time faculty are licensed and certified Board of Education personnel, empowered to recruit and interview new applicants for faculty positions, and to participate in curriculum development and peer review and evaluation. IHS has received several awards for its success, and provides a positive model for all college-high school collaboration efforts. (AJL)",

        "description":"In 1983, the San Jose/Evergreen Community College District Board of Trustees asked that all courses be given appropriate levels of reading, writing, and math prerequisites. Minimum competencies (generally 9th grade English reading and writing skills) were assigned to almost all district courses. A study was conducted to determine the degree to which reading and writing skill prerequisites were related to success in history courses, and the degree to which success was related to satisfying these prerequisites by coursework compared to placement testing. The history program was chosen because it contained courses required for graduation, because students in history have traditionally received a broad range of grades, and because history instructors thought that 9th grade reading  and writing skills were not sufficient to perform adequately in history classes. Study findings, based on the grades of all 1,632 students enrolled in history courses in fall 1987, included the following: (1) the higher the prerequisite level, the greater the student's chance of receiving an A, B, or C grade; (2) students who completed Freshman Composition had a 49% chance of earning an A or B grade in their history courses; and (3) students who entered history courses having fulfilled prerequisites through coursework were more apt to succeed than those who met prerequisites taking placement tests.

        "description":"Enrollment projections for Howard Community College (HCC) are made using an age cohort model that assumes that HCC will continue to enroll the same proportion of students in each age group as are represented in the current student population. Projections are made by calculating the ratio of HCC students in each age group to the number of county residents in the same age groups. These ratios are applied to population projections provided by the Maryland State Planning Center in order to derive enrollment projections. Projections for fiscal year (FY) 1989 fall enrollments using this model came within 3.76% of actual enrollments. There are three major sources of potential errors and/or differences with this model: (1) possible errors in the state planning projections; (2) fall 1988,  a year with a high participation rate, is used as the model year; and (3) the model does not consider the effect of tuition increases, if any, or other economic factors. Other factors that may affect enrollments are population growth, unemployment rates, and trends in the numbers of Howard County high school graduates. To account for a variety of unexpected factors, as well as the error margin inherent in any model, moderate projections are bracketed with low projections, which use fall 1987 as the model year for credit enrollment, and high projections, which attempt to include changes in courses and programs designed specifically to increase enrollment. The bulk of the report consists of charts and tables showing past enrollments and projections through 1994. (AJL)",

Part I offers background information on the issue, highlighting declining transfer rates and low persistence and graduation rates after transfer. After noting efforts that have been made to improve intersegmental cooperation, the report examines recent trends in transfer enrollments, indicating that the number of students transferring to the UC increased from 4,858 in fall 1986 to 5,840 in fall 1988, while the number transferring to the CSU increased from 27,761 to  28,300 in the same period. Caution in interpreting the trends is advised, given that over 50% of the transfers came from only 16 colleges and that underrepresented minorities continued to transfer at a very low rate. This section concludes by identifying concerns and needs for the future. Part II reports on specific activities undertaken in 1987-88 to strengthen articulation and transfer, including: (1) 2 + 2 + 2 projects among high schools, community colleges, and four-year institutions; (2) ongoing work to develop a general education transfer curriculum; (3) work to redefine the structure of the associate degree; (4) joint projects with the CSU; (5) activities of the Intersegmental Coordinating Council related to English as a Second Language instruction; (6) the Transfer Center Pilot  Project; (7) efforts of the California Articulation Number Project to develop a statewide cross-referenced course numbering system; and (8) Project ASSIST (Articulation System Stimulating Interinstitutional Student Transfer).

First, a summary is provided of trends toward the increasing dependence of students on loans to finance their college education and the large and growing default rate among borrowers. Next, four issues are discussed: Should lenders bear greater responsibility for the GSL default problem? Should educational institutions be held accountable for the default rates of their students? Should educational institutions be given a role in deciding who can borrow? And, are there alternatives for providing aid to some high-risk students? Following analyses of these issues, recommendations and proposals are put forth, calling for: (1) the assignment of increased accountability to  GSL lenders by requiring, for example, lenders to perform pre-loan counseling related to the cost of borrowing, repayment obligations, and the consequences of defaulting on a loan; (2) increasing the authority of colleges to determine whether students should be permitted to enter into a loan agreement by authorizing them to assign a risk-factor rating to applicants and allowing them greater discretion in certifying loan applications; and (3) increasing the effectiveness of work-study programs as an alternative to loans for low-income students.

Study findings included the following: (1) 18.7% of the students enrolled at PVCC in fall 1988 were first-time students, 15.8% were transfer students, and 65.5% were returning students; (2) between fall 1987 and fall 1988, student enrollment decreased by 3.7%, including a decrease of 1.3% among first-time students and 3.6% among transfer  students; (3) while the proportion of new to returning students remained fairly constant betwen 1984 and 1988, the proportion of first-time to transfer students was affected by a sharp plunge in the number of first-time students between 1984 and 1985 and a concurrent increase in the number of transfer students; (4) the percentage of black first-time students (10.4%) was much higher than that of black transfer students (5.6%); (5) over 30% of the first-time students attended full-time, compared to only 10.1% of the transfer students; and (6) a comparison of PVCC's new student profile with statewide figures on new students revealed that the typical PVCC student was more likely to be female, white, and older.

        "description":"An evaluation was made on the effects of an improved staff ratio in New Zealand kindergartens. Aspects of four typical kindergartens staffed by two teachers were compared with aspects of four kindergartens that were provided with a third teacher. Data were collected from teachers, kindergarten children and parents. Findings indicated that the introduction of a third teacher was associated with a statistically significant reduction in children's negative behavior in relation to peers. Children had more positive play with peers, talked more, and interacted more with teachers after the third teacher arrived. After the third teacher was introduced, teacher behavior showed fewer changes than did child behavior, but teachers in the third-teacher kindergartens made more nonverbal  initiations to children, talked more to parents, were more involved in children's play, and talked more to each other. Teachers believed that the introduction of a third teacher needed to be accompanied by considerable in-service work on leadership and management, and some findings lent credence to that belief. Adult-child ratios did not improve as much as expected in kindergartens with three teachers. It was concluded that the third teacher was a valuable addition, and that transition support should be provided. (RH)",

The people most affected by the actions of children are parents, merchants, and victims of vandalism. People who enter into contracts with children need to understand that minors may disaffirm their contracts and obtain a refund of any monies advanced. Parental responsibility for the torts of children is probably the most sensitive issue in this area of the law. Balancing a victim's right to be compensated with the imposition of parental liability is difficult. Arguably, the statutory limits on parental liability in most states are insufficient and should be increased to a higher  amount. In most circumstances, it is very difficult for victims to recover from parents under a negligent supervision theory. A highly publicized increase in the statutory parental liability could stimulate parents to discuss the implications of delinquent behavior with their children. This could be the first step toward eliminating the problem of vandalism. (RH)",

The section on toddlers' thinking explores physical activity as the basis of mental development, perspective taking, concepts, pretending, fantasizing, and language. The section on toddlers' development of  self-awareness deals with toddlers' limited objectivity, growing self-image, sensuality, gender development, will and competence, use of possessions to promote the sense of individuality, negativism, aggression, and need for clear-cut guidelines.

Subjects' behavior was observed in the integrated classroom and in playgrounds by means of a time sampling method that contained 9 categories of classroom behavior and 9 categories of playground behavior. Data indicated that the behavior of the integrated mildly handicapped students was in many ways similar to that of their regular class peers. Both groups of students showed low levels of negative, disruptive, and aggressive behavior in the classroom and playground. The groups did  not differ significantly in their amounts of interaction with adults or peers in the classroom. The groups' patterns of initiation with peers did not differ in either setting. But some differences were found between the groups' classroom and playground behaviors. Results are discussed in terms of theories of social acceptance and the influence of both individual and system factors on the successful integration of mildly disabled students. (RH)",

The kindergartens, which are part of the day care system, use methods based on the teachings of Friedrich Frobel. The general goal of kindergartens is to support the family in bringing up the child and join with the home in promoting the development of the child's personality. Kindergartens are of six types: (1) standard kindergartens; (2) kindergartens for school children; (3) special day care; (4) open kindergartens; (5) roving kindergartens; and (6) 24-hour kindergartens. Family day care includes care offered at the child minder's home, three-family day care, and group family day care. Play activity involves play clubs,  playgrounds, and toy libraries. The Finnish government has decided that by 1990, all families with children under three years should be able to send their children to a kindergarten or receive home-care support. Home-care support offers the parent the possibility of taking care of the child until it turns three. The law also ensures that the parent will not lose his or her employment during this period.

The Attitude Toward Mainstreaming Scale, which was designed by Larrivee and Cook (1979), has been used in evaluation studies in the United Sates and Australia. While the scale has been shown to be reliable, results concerning the factor structure of the scale have differed. In the present study, responses of a sample of 301 primary school staff were factor analysed to determine the scale's factorial validity. The scale was found to have an underlying conceptual framework of five factors, which could be used to investigate various aspects of a teacher's attitude toward integration.  Factors were: (1) general philosophy of integration; (2) teacher expertise; (3) demands on teacher time; (4) academic expectations; and (5) behavioral expectations. The psychometric characteristics of the scale indicate that it is both reliable and factorially valid in an Australian context, and that it is valid to make comparisons between American and Australian data using the scale.

A three-part questionnaire was completed by 317 staff members from 18 regular state primary schools and attached educational support centers.

        "description":"Provided is a revised estimate of the cost of The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1987 that takes into account possible revisions in employee eligibility, and the duration of allowable leave. As revised, the proposal would cover employees in firms with 50 or more workers who have been with the firm at least a year and have worked 1,000 or more hours during the previous 12-months. Over a 2-year period, employees would be permitted 10 weeks of unpaid leave upon the birth, adoption, or serious illness of a child, and 10 weeks for personal illness. Upon returning to work, an employee is guaranteed the same or an equivalent job. The legislation also specifies that employers must continue health benefits for workers on unpaid leave on the same basis as if they were still working, but  does not require the continuance of other employee benefits. It is estimated that the cost of this parental leave proposal to employers with 50 or more workers will be less than $147 million annually, and is likely to be less than that when all existing coverage is factored out of the estimate.

        "description":"A total of 80 infants who were 7 months old were asked to discriminate happy and surprised expressions based on compound or component changes in the eyes, mouth, or entire face. Four stimuli were employed: black and white photographs of a Caucasian female modeling happy and surprised expressions, and two hybrid expressions created by transposing eye and mouth regions from original stimuli. Ten infants were tested in each of eight recognition memory conditions. In four of the conditions, infants discriminated stimuli based on changes in a single component. In the remaining four conditions, infants were asked to recognize expression changes when compound changes occurred. The index of recognition was a novelty preference score, which was the total fixation time for the more novel  pattern divided by the total fixation time for both the novel and familiar patterns. When the infants were asked to recognize the familiar expression in the component conditions, they were successful when the change occurred in the mouth region. In the compound change conditions, the infants were again most sensitive to changes in the mouth. When changes occurred in the eye region, the infants were unable to recognize the familiar expression. Results suggest that in both compound and component conditions, 7-month-olds discriminate the facial expressions based on information in the mouth region. (RH)",

The instrument assessed dimensions of professionalism in the day-to-day activities of child caregivers. Findings indicated that a demographic profile created by a cross-sectional sample of child care providers differed markedly from a profile created by a sample based on professional affiliation. Statistical analyses indicated that level of education significantly affected caregivers' sense of the extent of their knowledge about aspects of their work. Data further indicated that the interaction of education and length of employment as a caregiver  significantly affected orientation to community. Only one-third of the workers had a degree at the baccalaureate or a higher level. Most did not belong to a professional organization. Less than half read professional journals. Discussion of findings focusses on the professional status of child care. Recommendations for enhancing the professional status of the field are offered. Over 50 references are cited.

Most states have implemented the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984. The most difficult provisions of the amendments to implement have involved bonds, expedited process, and wage withholding. Mentioned in the hearings also was the fact that current law (42 USC 644) allows parents who have custody of minor children to attach  federal income tax refunds of noncustodial parents who are behind in payments.

The program implements a curriculum that focuses on language and communication skills, cognitive skills, mathematical concepts, positive self-concept, positive attitudes toward learning, Afro-American and African studies, literacy, psychomotor skills, computer skills, and cultural arts. Features of the model include high affective support, self-concept development, creative expression, and consideration of the politics of holidays. Teaching strategies include body language, use of standard  English, use of equal talking time, enrichment of interactions with adults and peers, and use of music in class. A longitudinal, continuing study of the cognitive effects of the program during its first two years indicated that program participants scored higher on six tests during phase 1 than did matched subjects attending a high quality early childhood education center. Control group children scored higher on two tests, and no significant differences were found on nine tests. During phase 2, neither group scored higher than the other on any tests. (RH)",

Because children are aware of differences among the peers and the adults they encounter, children's questions must be answered accurately and in a developmentally appropriate way. When questions about individual difference arise, caregivers should assign no value to any difference. Societal values that prefer one difference over another--for example, white over black, rich over poor, male over female--stand in opposition to each child's right to full self-concept development. Because teachers are the central value transmitters in the classroom, they must support the individual differences of each child by examining their own fears, uncertainties, prejudices,  and limitations. They must then honestly confront themselves when they fail to support a child that is different. Four dimensions of individual difference are discussed: gender, biracial children, handicapped children, and minority children. For each difference, three issues are addressed: (1) what the teacher needs to know about the difference; (2) how the teacher should support the difference in the classroom and child care center; and (3) how the teacher should work with parents to support children with the difference.

        "description":"This review presents a framework that accommodates static and dynamic approaches to comprehension of students' transfer of knowledge and skill. The review focuses on three sets of variables considered fundamental to students' ability to access intellectual resources in potentially relevant situations: knowledge bases, strategies, and dispositions. It is argued that for all three categories of variables, the factors of cognitive organization and reflective awareness determine the extent to which individuals are able to use their intellectual resources. In the knowledge base category, the key organizational factor is the elaborateness of connections between units of knowledge. In the strategic category, the major organizational issue is the trade-off between general versus more  specific strategies. Awareness, denoted as &quot;metacognition&quot; here, is one of the most important factors influencing transfer. In the dispositions category, discussion of performance and mastery dispositions suggests that organization and awareness factors interact to influence dispositional thinking. Concluding remarks discuss ways in which teachers can attend to these factors to help students better use intellectual resources. Approximately 175 references are cited. (RH)",

Preliminary discussion reviews theoretical and empirical literature on organizational culture, levels of culture, features of culture in educational organizations, and the role of organizational culture in change. Subsequent discussion focuses on cultural effects on the kindergarten and middle school. The kindergarten serves as an example of an innovation which developed with little difficulty into a vital part of the educational system. But the middle school was an innovation that encountered mixed success. It is argued that the strong cultural values and  assumptions resulting from the early success of kindergarten programs facilitated the eventual adoption of the kindergarten as an integral level of the schooling structure. In contrast, the middle school, which was introduced without a common awareness of the value system underlying its creation, was thrust upon teachers and administrators before needed cultural changes could develop to undergird structural change. It is concluded that the future success of the middle school may depend on the construction of a culture of middle school values and assumptions. About 50 references are cited. (RH)",

        "description":"In general, retention at any grade level has not improved student achievement or social adjustment. Skimpy data on transition rooms seem to indicate that they are not very successful either. The reasons that have been given to explain why retention has not worked range from the school's inability to diagnose student needs to rigid curriculum and modes of instruction which have not addressed the culture, style, or initial skill level of incoming children. Mere repetition of a given grade has only served to widen the gap between retained and promoted children. When retention has worked, it has been in the earliest grades, when diagnosis has been careful and accurate; special resources have been applied; and individual needs and styles have been given close attention. Sections of  this research brief: (1) provide background information on nonpromotion; (2) probe related issues; (3) outline decision models for retention-promotion policies; and (4) indicate alternatives to retention.

        "description":"This paper presents survey results from rural areas having significant levels of employment both in agriculture and in extraction industries (coal mining). Although a review of the literature suggests that rural residents may express lower levels of environmental concern than urban residents, one study proposed that rural residents in farm-related industries might have different attitudes than those in extractive industries. The survey includes items dealing with specific local concerns over environmental protection and technological development. The data come from a study of four communities in western Colorado that were facing the prospect of large scale development of coal and other fossil fuel energy resources. Aside from the issues of planning and zoning, farmers and  ranchers in this sample were more concerned about environmental protection than persons in any other occupational category. The least environmental concerns were expressed by persons in coal mining and rapidly growing business and professional occupations. Qualitative interviews with area residents suggest that persons in agriculture valued environmental preservation in general, but were opposed to constraints of land use that might prevent them from obtaining high prices from the sale of their land. This study concludes that people in agriculture express higher levels of concern for environmental issues than do other rural persons living in the same community. The paper contains 71 references.

Lincoln and Clay Counties are very rural, traditionally poor areas, with 45% of their populations receiving welfare and much larger proportions receiving food stamps. Interviews with 82 poor families and local officials and community workers in the two counties revealed that: (1) much of the available housing is substandard; (2) poor families cannot afford safe and decent housing; (3) entire families live nomadic existences, moving from one substandard house to another; (4) bad water places families at risk in other areas of their lives; (5) families living in substandard conditions have high rates  of illness; (6) children living in substandard conditions have a high rate of school failure, or are &quot;gray area&quot; students (in need of help but not eligible for special education) and allowed to move through the school system without learning; (7) the state's Landlord-Tenant Act does not protect poor families who take what shelter is available; (8) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsidizes substandard housing with taxpayer money; (9) the State Department of Human Services does not recognize substandard housing in making homelessness funds available; and (10) existing programs that provide weatherizaton supplies or pay utilities do not address these problems adequately. The report makes recommendations concerning state housing and water standards, the issues of land  ownership and unemployment, investigations of state programs and use of HUD funds, local planning, and possible resources.

        "description":"San Elizario, Texas, is a border community with a high poverty rate, overcrowded school conditions, and a 60% limited English proficiency (LEP) rate among school students. In 1984, the school district began a cooperative university and school system project to improve Hispanic LEP students' achievement through applied computer technology. In 1987-88, the project provided computer assisted instruction in mathematics, language arts, and computer literacy to 119 students in grades 1-6 and 9-12, plus science and social science to older participants. A comparison of October 1987 and April 1988 standardized test scores showed improvement for most grade levels. The greatest reduction in the gap between participant scores and national norms occurred at grade 11 for composite scores  (29%), reading (48%), and language arts (25%), and at grade 6 for mathematics (81%). Questionnaires completed by school administrators and project staff indicated that, compared to their counterparts, project students had lower absentee, dropout, and retention rates, were less in need of specialized services, and were more likely to pursue postsecondary education. Classroom observers found capable teachers providing up to date instruction in appropriate environments, eager and well behaved students, and good rapport between project staff and other school staff. But observers also noted project weaknesses in the infrequent use of native language and home culture materials during instruction. Extensive appendices include questionnaires and observer surveys used; curriculum outlines;  software, hardware, and computer book inventories; and standardized test scores and statistics.

        "description":"This study examines the effects of recent statewide education reforms on small, rural schools in 13 Appalachian states. Education reform measures passed in the Appalachian states during 1982-1987 focused on improving schools through the following major approaches: (1) increased accountability through testing students and changing accreditation standards for schools; (2) higher minimum standards in schools and mandated curriculum improvements; (3) changes in teacher compensation, certification, and professional development; (4) new programs to improve administration and leadership; (5) mandated programs for special populations; and (6) increased state aid and changes in financial aid formulas. Forty-seven responses from a mail survey of 114 rural school districts and interviews  with 80 state policymakers and local education officials indicate that (1) reform implementation has stretched the administrative and financial capacity of rural school districts; (2) new curricula requirements have forced innovative approaches such as teacher sharing between districts and the use of technology in classroom instruction; (3) student test scores have improved over the past four years, but dropout rates remain high; (4) programs for special populations have added to the resources of rural schools; and (5) despite large increase in state aid to rural school districts, school improvements have required increases in local financing as well. Appendices outline the research methodology, summarize education reforms enacted and implemented in each of the 13 states since 1982,  present the survey results, and include the interview questions.

Speaking for several Native educators, Professor Roland Tharp of the University of Hawaii asked for congressional support and federal funding for a plan whereby six schools of six different Native American cultures would participate in a circle of assistance and teacher training.

All 88 New Mexico school districts and 100% of the 146 schools surveyed provided information on grade, sex, ethnicity, and reason for dropping out for students who left school prematurely. During 1986-87, 6,495 ninth through twelfth grade students dropped out, resulting in a dropout rate of 8.0%, up from 7.4% the previous school year. Males dropped out of school proportionately more than females, an effect which has been true each year of this annual study. The highest dropout rates occurred among Native American students (12.0%) and Hispanic students (9.0%), the lowest among Asian students  (4.1%). Native American students have consistently experienced the highest dropout rates. Anglo, Black, and Hispanic students experienced the highest dropout rates in grade 10, and Native American students in grade 9. The most frequent reason for dropping out was lack of motivation or interest (22.0% overall). Native American students had a disproportionately high rate of expulsion (17.3% versus 1.5-2.1% for other ethnic groups).

        "description":"Communications satellites transmit live interactive television broadcasts from a host site classroom to small and geographically isolated rural high schools. Using the research on effective teaching practices, this study examined the effectiveness of instruction delivered by satellite. Researchers observed 15 hours of three courses (Computer Science I, Art History I, and Sociology I) on the TI-IN Network. They calculated the frequency of the following teaching techniques using a content analysis design: (1) instructor initiated interaction; (2) student initiated interaction; (3) wait time; (4) level of questioning; (5) advance organizers; (6) statements of expectations for students; (7) review; (8) praise; and (9) corrective feedback. Researchers found that the instruction was  interactive, students and teachers were talking back and forth to each other via the medium. The three observed teachers asked a sufficient number of low- and high-level questions with appropriate teacher wait time to permit students an opportunity to process information. They used advanced organizers, review, praise, and corrective feedback. Teachers stated their expectations for the students. The teaching behaviors occurred to the same extent that they occur in a traditional classroom. Further research should focus on the effectiveness of programs on other satellite networks. This paper contains 20 references and one table. (KS)",

        "description":"A disproportionate share of the U.S. elderly population lives in nonmetro areas and has substantially more poverty than the metro elderly population. The nonmetro elderly's poverty rate was 21% in 1980 versus 13% for metro elderly, while median incomes were $4,111 versus $5,003. Lower personal incomes of the nonmetro elderly, regression analysis suggests, are explained more by their characteristics (such as low educational attainment, low occupational status, and not working) than by place of residence. Living without relatives or alone was the major factor contributing to poverty. Long-term care, welfare, and local planning to meet the elderly's needs take on added importance in rural areas where the Nation's trend toward a rapidly growing elderly population is exacerbated by  lower incomes of nonmetro people.

        "description":"This paper deals with managing a crisis in a wilderness situation. The terms &quot;crisis&quot; and &quot;turning point&quot; are used to describe what is more traditionally called an accident. Using these terms introduces the idea that crisis events occur as logical consequences of preceding decisions, errors, or omissions, not as the result of chance or fate. Ignoring the causes of risk and injury is a serious shortcoming in adventure education and planning. In order to prevent or deal with wilderness crises, three areas of expertise are required: (1) knowledge and skills; (2) preventive awareness; and (3) crisis management planning. Together these three areas form the wilderness crisis management triangle. Crisis management simulation is recommended for participants in a group wilderness  activity. The paper describes a six-part crisis resolution plan for training and simulation purposes. The plan considers decision making, search, rescue, first aid, evacuation, and notification. Making plans for these contingencies and weighing the individual's profile of competencies against the wilderness crisis management triangle is an obligation of a prudent adventurer or outdoor practitioner.

        "description":"This paper presents the findings of a study of the effectiveness of collaboration between the Rural Education Research and Service Consortium at Tennessee Technological University and rural schools in its service area. The study uses the instrumentation and research design of the Good Schools Project (GSP) initiated by Kappa Delta Pi in 1984. Baseline data collected in 1986 using the GSP structure are compared to data collected in spring 1988. Data were gathered by the consortium and analyzed in 11 conceptual dimensions: demographics, curriculum perspectives, goal attainment, classroom practices, interpersonal relations, commitment, discipline and safety, support services and facilities, decision-making, history, and achievement scores. Between the time of the baseline data  collection and the spring of 1988, strategies directed at areas of indicated weaknesses were implemented in 12 of the 40 schools from which baseline data were collected. This research report discusses both positive and negative changes. The 1988 sample included 9 of 40 schools used in the 1986 study. Numerous tables present the percentages of responses for the GSP sample, the Middle Tennessee Region 1986 sample, and the Middle Tennessee Region 1988 sample. The chi square test is reported on the tables. The report concludes that, although the study was originally designed to measure the impact of collaboration on rural school effectiveness, it has become instead a measure of the impact of state mandates and principal leadership on rural schools.

        "description":"This is a report about an inquiry into written proposals by the Scottish Education Department (SED) to increase the flow of academic staff between colleges of education and lower (primary and secondary) schools. This report describes the rationale of the SED consultative paper &quot;Movement of Academic Staff between Colleges of Education and Schools&quot;, which called for increasing staff exchanges and temporary transfers, or &quot;secondments,&quot; between colleges and the schools. This report describes responses from 13 Scottish education agencies and associations to the SED proposals. These descriptions are ordered according to the SED topics, and the responding agencies are not always identified by name. The responding agencies generally welcomed the SED proposals, and they offered  suggestions for implementing the new exchange and secondments policy. The report describes experiences and perceptions of teachers who had been seconded or were currently on secondment. Seven college of education lecturers who seconded to primary and secondary schools for up to two terms were also interviewed about their experiences. Topics discussed included: problems of adjustment, teachers' reasons for secondment, the perceived benefits for the schools, and the impact on colleges. Other educators and administrators involved with the program were also interviewed. One section deals with issues of administering secondment and exchange programs. All subjects' views are summarized in a final section. This report recommends that findings be seen as &quot;exploratory,&quot; but suggests that exchange  and secondment programs have merit when appropriately managed. The SED consultative paper is included. (TES)",

The purpose of the research was to help student teachers acquire an understanding of and control over teaching methods. The findings are from experiments with three samples of student teachers undergoing their initial training in Scotland. The first sample consisted of eight students at the start of their first college term. They were based at the same school to observe teachers. The second sample comprised four students, each having completed one college term, based at different schools for their observations. The third sample comprised four student teachers assigned to the same school in departments  according to their areas of specialty. All the students were instructed on how to interview cooperating teachers after their observation sessions. The substance and success of these interviews were then assessed by researchers. The document offers reactions to the experiment by students and teachers. Students were asked whether the interviews helped them gain a fuller understanding of the observed teaching. Cooperating teachers were asked about the positive and negative aspects of having student teachers discuss classroom methods with them. The students' interviews were compared with the researchers' recommended approach and assessed for the success in eliciting the desired information from teachers. No obvious differences among the three samples were apparent. The students had generally  favorable opinions of the interviews. All the cooperating teachers also responded favorably. There is some discussion about modifying and institutionalizing the procedure. (TES)",

These are not the only issues facing state and local education policy and planning communities. Nationwide focus on the school reform and school excellence movement poses another serious constraint on the workings of many rural school districts. This paper provides an overview of the school reform and school excellence movement of the past decade; discusses the major effects of economic, social and educational developments on rural school districts; and presents the principal implications held by the changing context of rural America concerning educational planning and policymaking for rural schools. Core considerations  for the discussion of new, comprehensive, integrated, and cohesive policies and programs for rural school improvement efforts include those discussed briefly in the following sections: (1) Different Policy and Program Strategies; (2) Comprehensive State Education Agency Planning; (3) Joint Planning with Other Public Service Providers; (4) Increasing Collaboration Among Educational Systems; (5) Planning a More Effective State School System Structure; (6) Strengthening Financial, Programming, and Staffing Practices; (7) Increasing Research and Development on Rural Education; (8) Emphasis on Capacity Building; and (9) Capitalize on Strengths of Rural Schools. What is required is a new commitment for the development of long-term, comprehensive, integrated, and cohesive strategic policies for  addressing the issues confronting rural education. The core considerations can be used for the formulation of such policies. This paper contains 13 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"Children in the United States and other industrialized countries grow to adulthood in an age of science and technology. Satellites, television sets, microprocessors, and microwave ovens are as common as the sun and trees. The context of socialization to adulthood in the last half of the 20th century is far different in kind than any previous socialization environment. It is likely that the socialization environment for our grandchildren will be characterized even more strongly by science and technology. Despite these changes in the socialization environment, there has been little systematic study of the effects of growing up in a scientific and technological world on the formation of attitudes toward science and technology. Some commentators have claimed to have found alienation  toward science and technology, while others think that it has captured the imagination of newer generations. The Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) is one effort to better understand the process of socialization and attitude development toward science and technology and citizenship. This paper presents the preliminary results from the LSAY base year 7th-grade data set to examine the origins of student interest in science and mathematics, using a set of multivariate log-linear models to examine the structure of parental and peer influences on the student's attitudes.

When teachers are aware of the relationship between science and society, they can relate classroom learning to practical application. This results in more positive student attitudes. The continuous evolving of scientific knowledge requires teachers to keep up with the latest developments in order to provide current information and experiences for their students. This paper reports on a program that was developed to help teachers facilitate learning and transfer scientific knowledge, experiences, and attitudes to their students. The 23 participants involved in the program reported that the program had increased their: (1) knowledge about research and application of science and  mathematics outside the classroom; (2) awareness of the relationship of subject matter to industry and careers; and (3) interest in research and applied science. Included is an introduction, a description of the program, instrumentation and method, analysis, results, discussion, and references. Presented tables include program effects on participants and participants' confidence, results of tests comparing frequency of teaching activities before, and one year after, the program; and the impact on research and demonstration activities.

The information presented here is concerned primarily with radon which enters a house from the underlying soil. The first lesson to learn about radon reduction is this: No two houses are alike. Even houses that look the same have small differences in construction that can affect radon entry and the design and effectiveness of reduction techniques. Underlying soils also may vary,  even among houses which sit close together.

The pressure to feed increasing numbers of people helps cause high rates of topsoil loss which results in decreased agricultural productivity. As poorer nations attempt to fight these problems, millions of their children die of preventable diseases. On the other hand, rising industrialization has caused acid rain and air pollution, leading to the death of lakes, forests and streams, and endangering human health. Individual efforts to combat these enormous threats appear miniscule but, when added together, their impact has the ability to revolutionize the earth.

The cognitive demands of a thermodynamics curriculum were successively refined while maintaining the same microcomputer based laboratory (MBL) software and the same basic experiments. The 13-week curriculum was reformulated four times, and each version was evaluated using the same criteria. Overall, a four- to ten-fold increase in student learning (depending on the criteria applied) was achieved as a result of reformulations based on cognitive research. The results showed that some suggestions from research offer promise for use in realistic  settings and that other suggestions such as &quot;offer multiple representations&quot; are wrong or incomplete when applied in realistic settings.

There is, among the several policy reports, substantial agreement that student achievement levels in mathematics are lower than is desirable and the opportunity to learn mathematics, science and technology is at present not fairly and evenly provided to all students. In particular, large numbers of minority youngsters and those who go to inner-city schools are below grade level in mathematics achievement by grade five. Girls, too, show disparities in interest, participation and achievement, but for different reasons. The situation for minority girls is even more complex. The goal of this study was to conduct a  comprehensive review of the research and intervention literature on math, science and computer learning among girls, minority students and inner-city students in grades four through eight. Chapters concern: (1) the studies used in this report; (2) differences and similarities in participation; (3) differences and similarities in performance; (4) factors related to performance and participation; (5) intervention programs; and (6) summary and recommendations.

This paper attempts to investigate the question of whether data from transcripts of scientists thinking aloud have the potential to speak to these issues. A case study is examined in which the subject generates a new explanatory model hypothesis--a predictive analogy which describes a hidden process explaining a phenomenon. Findings from the case study appear to show that it is possible to study hypothesis formation and creative insight processes in thinking  aloud protocols. The present study suggests a view of hypothesis formation in science that is more complex than can be provided by either an inductivist, rationalist, Eurekaist, or accretionist position alone. Recent analyses of Darwin's thought processes are found to be similar in many respects to the present analysis of thinking aloud data. (Author/YP)",

The study develops an outcome approach model of informal reasoning under certainty and presents a few excerpts from conversations with students about probability to demonstrate how statements can be understood according to the outcome approach. Three kinds of students' reasoning statements  are discussed: confusing statements, statements that sound incorrect, and statements which contain two conflicting views. This study suggests three general types of criteria against which students are encouraged to evaluate their current beliefs. These are the fit between their beliefs and: (1) the beliefs of others; (2) their other, related beliefs; and (3) empirical observations. (YP)",

The programs can be used as a means of extending or enriching textbook material in either high school mathematics or Pascal courses. Some suggested uses are: (1) teacher demonstrations in mathematics classes; (2) programs for student use in mathematics classes; and (3) student assignments in a mathematics or Pascal course. The topics which are addressed in the Pascal programs come from a variety of mathematical areas: algebra, trigonometry, discrete mathematics, number theory, mathematical modeling, and numerical algorithms. Generally speaking, the programs are quite short and the programming level is appropriate for the average high  school student who is enrolled in a Pascal course or who has completed such a course. The appendix contains standard types and procedures used by graphics programs written for use with Turbo Pascal on the IBM PC, including Cleargraphics, Graphicson, Graphicsoff, Plotpoint, Smoothplot, Drawline, PlotGeneral, DrawlineGeneral, DrawCircleGeneral, plotaxes, ConvertToPolar, and Rotate.

One is understanding what a scientific theory is, and the other is understanding the methods used in conducting scientific research. In the science curriculum these topics are often described as the process of science as opposed to scientific facts. Students, along with learning about the content of the different scientific disciplines, need an emphasis on the scientific process as well. Two questions are considered concerning students engaging in various activities presented to them: (1) how do students think about these problems; and (2) what kinds of activities and materials are best suited for this kind of introduction to the scientific  method? Three components of a unit dealing with these questions have been developed and piloted. The computer program &quot;The King's Rule&quot; was used to introduce hypothesis formation and testing. The program &quot;The Scientific Method&quot; was used to study experimental conditions and the effects of phenomena under investigation. The third unit experiments with natural language phenonema. The pilot program is presented along with excerpts and transcripts taken during trials of the program. (MVL)",

These aims led ETC to establish collaborative research groups in which people whose primary interest was classroom teaching and learning, and researchers concerned primarily with developing and testing theory, would keep each other honest. Several such groups identified targets of difficulty in the K-12 science, mathematics, and programming curricula and proceeded to develop experimental approaches including new technologies to improve teaching of these conceptually difficult topics. Most groups began with close observations of individual students and progressed to design materials and  activities for teaching experiments which they conducted first with small groups and then with whole classrooms. Three of ETC's research groups had the following proposals: (1) using microcomputer based laboratory equipment and other technologies to teach students about heat and temperature; (2) infusing a programming &quot;metacourse&quot; into introductory classes in BASIC; and (3) teaching with the &quot;Geometric Supposers&quot; to incorporate inductive reasoning into traditional geometry courses.

High school teachers often find that thermal concepts are very difficult for their students to master and attribute students' difficulties at least in part to the failure to differentiate between heat and temperature. This failure would indeed account for the students' poor learning, since most thermal variables, laws, and principles are based on the differentiation and relation between heat and temperature. This group's curriculum has used microcomputers as laboratory tools: Microcomputer-Based Laboratories (MBL) allow students to collect, display, and summarize data collected from the &quot;real  world,&quot; while with Computer Laboratory Simulations students watch &quot;ideal&quot; experiments on the screen, setting parameters, not collecting data. Classroom interventions have helped students at the problem-solving level: students taught with microcomputers were better than control students at solving quantitative problems of the type given in science tests, but no evidence was found that the computer-based curriculum facilitated conceptual change. This report summarizes past work and the development of computer conceptual models, and reports the results of a pilot study conducted to test the models. (CW)",

Students' initial epistemological stance concerning scientific knowledge is that knowledge is a passively acquired, faithful copy of the world, and that the inquiry process is limited solely to observing nature, rather than constructing explanations of phenomena in nature. The assumption guiding this curricular intervention is that if students are to gain a better understanding of the  nature of scientific inquiry and knowledge, they must be actively involved in constructing and evaluating explanations for natural phenomena, and they must be engaged in metaconceptual reflection on that process.

Inquiry problems differ from traditional, single-answer textbook problems in that they must leave room for student initiative and creativity. The observations presented in this paper about the delicate balance between specifying too much instruction and too little, which is part of creating and posing inquiry problems, are based on careful examination of students' inquiry problem papers. The paper also discusses speculations on whether these  observations suggest general lessons for those seeking practical and successful strategies to introduce student inquiry into classrooms, with the hope of stimulating interest in and discussion of such strategies.

By seeking to apply new technological capabilities at these particular points in the curriculum, they have attempted to make a real difference in the ability of schools to educate students. From the beginning it was realized that making a difference in schools would require a different sort of research and development approach than  had previously been tried in science and mathematics education. A framework and five-point focus has become the hallmark of the Center's work: (1) subject matter; (2) student's ideas about subject matter; (3) teaching for understanding; (4) technology; and (5) implementation.

        "description":"Trying to change the predictive rule for the sinking and floating phenomena, students have a great difficulty in understanding density and they are insensitive to empirical counter-examples designed to challenge their own rule. The purpose of this study is to examine the process whereby students from sixth and seventh grades relinquish their predictive rule in the face of counter-examples and to examine two variables that might affect their interpretation of counter-examples: the use of a computer simulation as conceptual referent, and prior awareness of an alternative concept of density. Two computer programs, &quot;Weight and Density&quot; and &quot;Sink the Raft,&quot; were used as the treatment materials. Results show two main effects from the two variables. However, none of the differences in  the groups remained by a posttest administered six to seven weeks after the experimental sessions. Appendices include 13 figures; 35 tables; scripts for introduction, model guided observation, and observation without the computer model; outline of treatments; a paper and pencil test; and scoring criteria.

Results from genetics learning studies and needs assessments demonstrated the need for additional intensive research in biology education and genetics learning. There exists a lack of detailed information describing reasoning patterns and processes of learners solving genetics problems using an interactive medium to explore their ideas and test hypotheses. The purposes of this study were to: (1) explore problem solving behaviors and genetics concepts employed by experts and novices during interaction with a genetics computer simulation; and (2) examine, extract, and analyze common and unique characteristics of successful and unsuccessful subjects. Three experts (Ph.D.s in  Biology) and ten novices (advanced biology secondary students) participated in the study. Two experts and two novices exhibited the most complex patterns of problem-solving sequences and principally used problem-solving sequences. These were the successful subjects. The least successful subjects, five novices, exhibited more random approaches during problem solving. An intermediate group of less successful problem solvers exhibited some of the problem solving sequences of successful subjects. Included are tables, diagrams, and a list of references. (RT)",

Known as the National Council for Geographic Education Competency-Based Geography Test, Secondary Level, Form D, this test was used to measure the students' level of geographic ability in: (1) map skills; (2) place-name map identification; (3) physical geography; and (4) human geography. Information was obtained concerning each student's: (1) major area of study; (2) home state of residence; (3) class status; (4) other U.S. and foreign residencies; (5) excursions outside of the home state; (6) sex; (7) age; (8) ethnic group; (9) reasons for taking the course; and (10) previous geographic education. Findings indicated that  a low overall level of geographic skills and knowledge exists and that these students averaged test scores of 75 percent correct on place-name map identification, 70 percent on map skills, 63 percent on human geography, and 58 percent on physical geography. Along with overall ability, factors such as age, major area of study, frequency of travel, number of places visited outside the home state, and reasons for taking the course positively influenced the level of geographic skills and knowledge.

        "description":"Television is one of the most pervasive forms of communication and one of the most influential and visible forms of popular culture. Some researchers believe that the mass communication capability of television has increased cultural homogeneity in all but a very few places. This paper contends that the American, National, and Columbia Broadcasting networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) present enough variation in programming to permit television to be a variable, not homogeneous, mass medium. Differences also occur in the number of television channel choices available in individual homes. None of these three networks provides complete national programming delivery, and some geographic areas receive programming from only one or two of the three networks. A difference exists in the  broadcast range between Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) stations, and local stations may consciously delete selected programs. Program content analysis and audience surveys are needed to determine if variations in communication patterns produce a diversity in U.S. popular culture.

This report is the first to be issued. Although community humanities' programs have increased, the number of college students enrolled in humanities courses has dropped considerably within the last 20 years. The effect scholarship has had on teaching and the emphasis on current political issues in classrooms are discussed. The role of the Western tradition as a focus for education is debated as higher education institutions create courses and undergraduate requirements in non-Western courses. The effects of television on the reading habits of U.S. citizens is outlined and this medium's potential for the humanities includes  educational programming on public television stations and the availability of films on videocassettes. The public's support of the &quot;William Wordsworth and the Age of English Romanticism&quot; exhibition, opened at the New York Public Library in October, 1987, reflects its growing interest in such projects. The report concludes with a series of recommendations on how the humanities can be strengthened by the three major providers of public education: colleges and universities; television; and the &quot;parallel school,&quot; i.e., museums, libraries, humanities councils, historical organizations, and the like.

This paper traces school reform efforts in the United States, England, and Wales since the 1960s and highlights selected books, laws, reports, and programs that relate to reforms in economics education or educational equity. The document suggests that educational organizations are striving for improvements and that voters decide the speed and quality of the  changes by whom they elect and how strongly they demand reform action.

The section on historical background highlights underrepresentation of women as students, employees, and leaders in higher education. Federal policies that are examined include the Fair Labor Standards Act (1938), the Equal Pay Act (1963), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964), the Education Amendments (1972), and Executive Order 11246 (1965). Sexual discrimination and harassment issues and problems are featured. Recommendations from the  Carnegie Commission's (1973) report regarding opportunities for women in higher education and from &quot;The Personnel Administrator&quot; (P. Somers, J. Clementson-Mahr) about handling sexual discrimination situations are provided. A 32-item bibliography is included. (JHP)",

        "description":"A description is given of the perceptions and attitudes of 10 teachers currently working in the Dade County (Florida) schools. The paper examines the extent to which changes over the past two decades have affected the ways in which they perceive their work and the teaching profession in general. These teachers entered teaching primarily for intrinsic rewards and a desire to help young people learn. However, frustration was consistently felt as a response to numerous external forces interfering with the teaching-learning process. These forces included the &quot;school system&quot; with all of its various bureaucratic components, uninterested parents, the students themselves, and, for some teachers, the union. In a general sense there was a marked difference in the ways that individual  teachers responded to and coped with external forces. The data for this study were gathered from interviews with 10 teachers randomly selected from a sample of 42 teachers. The interviews covered a wide-range of subjects including: (1) teachers' reasons for entering the profession; (2) their views of the conditions under which they worked; (3) the rewards and incentives available to them; and (4) their attitudes concerning major social and educational movements. The subjects represented a cross-section of teachers working in urban, suburban and rural schools, and in regular and special education settings at the elementary and secondary levels. (JD)",

Part 1 provides an introduction and overview of the evaluation study; it includes information regarding the purpose of the study, the study design and analysis, and the issue of confidentiality. Part 2 focuses on the nature of the pilot mentor-intern projects--their goals, structures, and resources--and a variety of issues that are related to developing and sustaining a local project. The third part deals with the mentor-intern relationship specifically; it provides information on who the mentors and interns were, on how the matches between mentors and interns were made, how the relationships formed and grew, what the mentors and  interns did together or individually, and other issues related to this central feature of the MT-I Program. Part 4 focuses on the impact the local projects have had on participants and other educators in the local setting, as well as on the school as an organization. The final part draws a set of conclusions from the three middle parts, and on that basis offers a set of recommendations regarding future policy, planning, and practice related to the work of the MT-I Program.

        "description":"This pilot study sought to establish validity of a teacher career development model based on results from previous research which had isolated a series of career stages and several characteristics of each stage. The model was constructed to identify characteristics associated with effective and ineffective transfer of knowledge from teacher to students. Perceptions of principals and teachers regarding 160 characteristics of teachers identified 4 distinct career stages: Provisional, Development, Transition, and Decelerating, each with associated characteristics which made logical sense and appeared to corroborate previous findings of research involving principals. Findings support the need for teacher renewal; the model suggests a framework for matching staff development  activities to the classroom and the career stage of the teacher. The appendixes provides a proposed model for instructional development and the survey form listing the 160 teacher characteristics. (JD)",

        "description":"Age, gender, and/or previous experience seem to be related to the performance/learning of new perceptual motor tasks. This study sought to determine the relative interrelationships of age, gender, and the depth of sport experience on initial practice of a complex perceptual motor soccer task for 46 children 4- to 9-years-old who were enrolled in a community center day camp. Depth of sport experience was identified by the amount of time the child had played organized competitive sports. Each performance was evaluated by performance time, movement accuracy, and goal attainment. The test involved moving one's self through a stationary environment while controlling and interacting with a moving soccer ball. It was concluded that age and experience are most important to the quality of  performance, and there were no constructs related to consistency for this age group. It is suggested that experience negates gender effects in children for the initial performance of complex perceptual motor tasks. Eleven figures are included. (JD)",
