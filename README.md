# Save ERIC

In order to maintain the ERIC database, as it has recently come under threat as an extention to the threats on the Department of Education, I am trying to copy all document URLs and all ERIC-hosted files.

If time is as thin as I think it is, this is not something that can be done alone. If you or anyone you know can help, please do consider it.
