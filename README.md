# Save ERIC

In order to maintain the ERIC database, as it has recently come under threat as an extention to the threats on the Department of Education, I am trying to copy all document URLs and all ERIC-hosted files.

If time is as thin as I think it is, this is not something that can be done alone. If you or anyone you know can help, please see below:

## We need ids

To get the files, we need each file's ERIC id. We can get each id using the API. See the video for details.

Once we have the ids, they can be used to get all the URLs and ERIC pdfs.

## Plan for after?
That's still in the works. As I said, I wrote the code about an hour ago.
